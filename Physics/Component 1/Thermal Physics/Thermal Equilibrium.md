Two [[Thermodynamic Systems|systems]] in thermal contact are in thermal equilibrium if there is no flow of [[Heat]] between them. They are said to be at the same temperature

## Thought Experiments
### Model system
For the following thought experiments we will use a model system as a way of monitoring the [[Internal Energy]]
![[Thermal Equilibrium 2024-03-02 22.55.18.excalidraw]]
The only aspect that we'll measure in the thought experiments is the height of the gas column, $h$. This is proportional to the volume of the gas. The pressure is a constant, so the [[Internal Energy]] of the system is also proportional to $h$
### Experiment 1
Imagine our model system in thermal contact with another system, for example a large block of metal:
![[Thermal Equilibrium 2024-03-02 23.02.03.excalidraw]]
If the internal energy of the model system remains constant, we say the two systems are in thermal equilibrium. We know $U$ is constant because $h$ stays constant
### Experiment 2
This time, consider two separate systems that are separate to start with, which we bring together
![[Thermal Equilibrium 2024-03-02 23.10.52.excalidraw]]
When we bring them together, we notice the piston rises and then stops rising. Because $U=\frac{3}{2}pV$, we conclude that energy has moved into our model system from the metal block. This spontaneous flow of energy between two systems which are not in thermal equilibrium is called [[Heat]]. We say heat has flowed from the metal block into the gas (through the conducting wall of the cylinder)
We can also use this experiment to define the concept of temperature. Two systems in thermal equilibrium with each other are said to be 'at the same temperature'. If heat flows from system 2 to system 1, system 2 is said to have a higher temperature, i.e. we define temperature in terms of the direction of heat flow: heat flows from a high to a low temperature
### Experiment 3
Consider two model systems, each separately in thermal equilibrium with our metal block. We then bring them into thermal contact with each other, we find that they are also in thermal equilibrium
![[Thermal Equilibrium 2024-03-02 23.18.54.excalidraw]]
This is the [[Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics]]
