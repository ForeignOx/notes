The law of conservation of energy applied to [[Thermodynamic Systems]] is referred to as the first law of thermodynamics:
When net [[Heat]], $Q$, flows into a system which does net [[Work]], $W$, [[Energy Transfer by Work|on its surroundings]], the [[Internal Energy]], $U$, changes according to the relationship:
$$
\Delta U=Q-W
$$
