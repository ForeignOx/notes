[[Work]] is the product of force and distance moved in the direction of the force, the [[Energy]] transfer is equal to the work done
Consider a [[Thermodynamic Systems|system]] expanding into its surroundings:
![[Energy Transfer by Work 2024-03-03 20.53.48.excalidraw]]
Assuming that the surroundings contain molecules, the system will need to exert a force on the surroundings and, unless energy is supplied to the system, its [[Internal Energy|Internal Energy]] must decrease
## Work done by expanding gas at constant pressure
Consider the model below
![[Energy Transfer by Work 2024-03-03 21.00.15.excalidraw]]
The gas in the cylinder is doing work by expanding and pushing back the piston. If it exerts a force $F$, and expands a distance, $d$, then:
$$
W=F\Delta x
$$
If $p$ is the gas pressure, and $A$ is the cylinder cross-sectional area, then
$$
F=pA
$$
$$
\implies W=pA\Delta x
$$
But $A\Delta x=\Delta V$, the increase in volume of gas
$$
\therefore W=p\Delta V
$$
Note that neither the orientation of the cylinder nor whether piston is frictionless are relevant. The expression $p\Delta V$ simply gives the energy transfer to the piston and whatever it is connected to; it doesn't indicate what form the energy takes
## Work done by an expanding gas with varying pressure
The equation $W=p\Delta V$ for a constant pressure expansion tells us that, if the pressure varies during the expansion, the total work done for an expansion fro volume $V_{1}$ to $V_{2}$ is given by:
$$
W=\int _{V_{1}}^{V_{2}}p(V) \, dV 
$$
i.e. the area under a $p-V$ graph
