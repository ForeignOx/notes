The rise in temperature, $\Delta\theta$, of an object, provided no change of state occurs is found experimentally to be closely proportional to the [[Heat]] input, $Q$. For a element, compound, or mixture of fixed composition, $\Delta\theta$ is inversely proportional to the mass of the material, so for a given material, we can say:
$$
Q=mc\Delta\theta
$$
Where $c$ is the specific heat capacity of the material, which is equal to the heat per unit mass needed to raise the temperature of a material per degree
