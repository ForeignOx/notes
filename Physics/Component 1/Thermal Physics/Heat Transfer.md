If two [[Thermodynamic Systems|systems]] are in thermal contact, then [[Heat]] will flow from the system at the higher temperature into the one at lower temperature, this will continue until the systems are in [[Thermal Equilibrium]]. Assuming there is no heat exchange with the surrounding, we can say that the heat flow from one system is equal to the heat flow into the other, which will allow us to calculate the equilibrium temperature

Consider two systems where $\theta_{1}$ and $\theta_{2}$ are the initial temperatures, Let the final temperature be $\theta$

Then the heat loss by system 1 is equal to the heat gain by system 2:
$$
m_{1}c_{1}(\theta_{1}-\theta)=m_{2}c_{2}(\theta-\theta_{2})
$$
