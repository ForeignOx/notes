 The first internal combustion [[Heat Engine|engine]] was build by Nikolaus Otto, using coal as instead of petrol, using an operating sequence known as the otto cycle. 
The power processes in a petrol engine take place in a cylinder in which an air/petrol mixture is ignited to drive a piston, this is how a typical cylinder looks:
![[Otto Cycle 2024-03-03 21.37.57.excalidraw]]
$V_{1}$ is the maximum volume of the cylinder and $V_{2}$ is the minimum volume of the cylinder. This is what a typical graph for the variation of pressure with volume, known as an indicator diagram

- The intake stroke is when a mixture of air and petrol vapour is drawn into the cylinder
- The compression stroke is when the piston compresses the air/petrol mixture rapidly. In the process its pressure and temperature increase
- The ignition phase (2->3) is when the mixture is ignited (by the spark plug) and burns rapidly, increasing the temperature (and pressure) of the mixture
- The power stroke is when the high pressure gas mixture expands forcing back the piston
- Then the valve opens, releasing the exhaust gases, which are then expelled (4->1)
- Then there is an exhaust stroke which is when the piston pushes the waste gases into the atmosphere
The energy transfer in the power stroke is the area under the line, this comes from the internal energy of the petrol/air. But in order to achieve this, we need to compress the mixture, and this takes work, so the net output is given by the area between the two lines
### Power output
A petrol engine normally has several cylinders (often 4 in cars and operates at over 1000 rpm. Hence the maximum power output, $P_\text{max}$ of an engine is given by:
$$
P_\text{max}=nf(W_{1}-W_{2})
$$
Where $n$ is the number of cylinders, $f$ is the engine [[frequency]] and $W_{1}-W_{2}$ is the net energy output
### [[Efficiency]]
Even in an ideal engine, we cannot get out 100% of the energy we put in. The maximum possible efficiency is
$$
\eta _\text{max}=\frac{W_{1}-W_{2}}{W_{1}}
$$
To improve efficiency, we need to make the compression stroke as low as possible and the power stroke as high as possible. For the same mass of mixture, this means making, $T_{1}$, the temperature of the gases at 1 as low as possible and $T_{3}$, the temperature at the end of combustion as high as possible
There is a reasonable argument that the values of work are proportional to the maximum and minimum temperatures, hence:
$$
\eta \leq \frac{T_{3}-T_{1}}{T_{3}}
$$
