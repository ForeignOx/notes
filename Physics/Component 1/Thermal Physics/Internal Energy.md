The internal energy of a [[Thermodynamic Systems|system]] ($U$) is them of the [[Energy]] possessed by all the particles in the system, usually the sum of the [[Kinetic Energy]] (translational and rotational) and the potential energy. Potential energy covers a variety of different types of energy such as [[Gravitational Potential Energy|gravitational]], [[Elastic Potential Energy|elastic]], [[Intermolecular Forces]], chemical bonds, excited energy states in atoms and nuclear energy states
Typically only changes in internal energy $\Delta U$ need to be considered, so many forms of energy that stay constant need not be considered. If the system is a sample of an [[Ideal Gas Equation|ideal gas]], then intermolecular forces can be ignored and we can consider $U$ to consist entirely of the molecular kinetic energy, so $U\propto T$, and, more specifically, for a monatomic gas:
$$
U=\frac{3}{2}nRT
$$
which can also be written as
$$
U=\frac{3}{2}pV
$$
