When you put [[Energy]] into a system, some of the energy will be wasted to dissipative forces, (usually [[Friction]]), so we measure how efficient a process is by using the formula:
$$
\text{Efficiency}=\eta=\frac{\text{useful energy transfer}}{\text{total energy input}}\times 100\%=\frac{\text{useful power output}}{\text{total power input}}\times 100\%
$$
In a chain of energy transfers, the total efficiency is the product of the efficiencies at each stage.
