If a force moves something, we say that the force does work:
$$
W=Fx
$$
the $x$ is distance travelled in the direction of motion, work done has the unit of $\pu{ J }$
If the direction of force and displacement are not in the same direction, we can say:
![[Work 2024-02-07 18.30.48.excalidraw]]
$$
W=Fx\cos \theta
$$
