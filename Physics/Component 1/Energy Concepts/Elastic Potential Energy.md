Elastic objects which are deformed are able to do [[Work]] on other objects when they return to their normal shape. Thus they possess [[Energy]] because of their deformation, we call this elastic potential energy.
When an object is deformed in this way, the extent of the deformation depends on the applied force. Many objects obey [[Hooke's Law]], at least for small deformations.
The work done in stretching the string due to the force is given by:
$$
W=\int_{0}^x F(x) \, dx 
$$
Where $F(x)$ is the force for a given extension $x$. Using Hooke's law, $F=kx$ for some spring constant $k$, hence:
$$
W=\int^x_{0} kx \, dx=\left[ \frac{kx^{2}}{2} \right]_{0}^x=\frac{1}{2}kx^{2}
$$
If the string is allowed to relax, it can do work as it does so equal to the work done in stretching it, so elastic potential energy $E_{p}$ is given as:
$$
E_{p}=\frac{1}{2}kx^{2}
$$
