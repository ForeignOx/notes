A moving object can do [[Work]] on other objects in coming to rest. Thus it possesses energy because of its motion. We call this kinetic [[Energy]], which has a symbol of $E_{K}$
Consider an object of [[Mass]] $m$ moving with [[Velocity]] $u$, subject to a force $F$ over a displacement $x$ such that $F$ and $x$ are in the same direction.
$$
W=Fx=max=m\frac{1}{2}(v^{2}-u^{2})
$$
(for a constant acceleration)
## Rotational Motion
$$
K=\frac{1}{2}m  \underline{\dot{r}}\cdot\underline{\dot{r}}=\frac{1}{2}m(\dot{r}^{2}+r^{2}\dot{\theta}^{2})
$$
Since $\underline{\dot{r}}=\dot{r}\underline{e}_{r}+r\dot{\theta}\underline{e}_{\theta}$
We can use the [[Angular Momentum|angular momentum]] to write:
$$
\dot{\theta}=\frac{L}{mr^{2}}
$$
To say
$$
K=\frac{1}{2}m\left( \dot{r}^{2}+\frac{L^{2}}{m^{2}r^{2}} \right)
$$
