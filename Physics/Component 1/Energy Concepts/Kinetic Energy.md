A moving object can do [[Work]] on other objects in coming to rest. Thus it possesses energy because of its motion. We call this kinetic [[Energy]], which has a symbol of $E_{K}$
Consider an object of [[Mass]] $m$ moving with [[Velocity]] $u$, subject to a force $F$ over a displacement $x$ such that $F$ and $x$ are in the same direction.
$$
W=Fx=max=m\frac{1}{2}(v^{2}-u^{2})
$$
(for a constant acceleration)
