For a material of uniform composition, the mass of a sample is directly proportional to its volume, $m \propto V$, which implies $\frac{m}{V}$ is constant. We define this constant as density, $\rho=\frac{m}{V}$
Some example densities at $0^{\circ}\pu{ C }$ and atmospheric pressure:

| Material | $\rho / \pu{ kgm-3 }$ |
| ---- | ---- |
| Air | 1.29 |
| Water | 1000 |
| Brick | 2300 |
| Petrol | 880 |
| Steel | 7900 |
| Aluminium | 2800 |
| Mercury | 13600 |
| Gold | 19300 |
| Interstellar space | $10^{-51}$ |
| Red giant star | $10^{-3}$ |
| The sun | 1418 |
| White dwarf | $1.42\times 10^{9}$ |
| Neutron star | $2.96\times 10^{17}$ |
