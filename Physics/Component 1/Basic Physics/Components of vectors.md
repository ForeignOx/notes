For some vector $V$ at an angle $\theta$ from a desired line, for example the x-axis:
![[Components of vectors 2024-02-06 12.37.24.excalidraw]]We define the horizontal component of $V$, $V_{h}=V\cos\theta$, and the vertical component, $V_{v}=V\sin\theta$, and note using these definitions, $V^{2}=V_{v}^{2}+V_{h}^{2}$, by pythagoras
