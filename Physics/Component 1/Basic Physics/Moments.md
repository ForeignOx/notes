The turning effect of a force about a point depends upon its direction as well as the distance from a point. We take account of this when we define the moment of a force. The moment of a force about a point is the product of the force and the perpendicular distance from the point to the line of action of the force. The moment of a force can also be called its torque, $t$ and has units $\pu{ Nm}$. Moments can be clockwise or anticlockwise

To calculate this moment, there are two ways of going about it, one is to note that $d=x\cos\theta$, so $t=Fx\cos\theta$, or that the [[Components of vectors|perpendicular component]] is $F_{p}=F\cos\theta$, hence giving the equivalent result $t=F\cos\theta x$
