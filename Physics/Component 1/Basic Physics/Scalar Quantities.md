Scalar quantities have only magnitude, unlike [[Vectors|vector quantities]]. Scalar quantities follow normal rules of arithmetic
Some examples of scalars are: [[Density]], [[Mass]], volume, area, distance, length, [[Speed]], [[Work]], [[Energy]], [[Git?/Physics/Component 1/Energy Concepts/Power]], time, [[Resistance|resistance]], temperature, potential (or [[Potential Difference]] or voltage or emf), [[Electric Charge]], capacitance, activity, pressure
