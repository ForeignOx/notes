In order to measure a quantity, we need to have a defined standard to compare with. Le système international d'unités (abbreviated to SI) is the system of units we use for this.

| Name of quantity | Symbol | Name of unit | Abbreviation |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| mass | m | kilogram | $\pu{ kg }$ |
| length | l | metre | $\pu{ m }$ |
| time | t | second | $s$ |
| electric current | I | ampere | $\pu{ A }$ |
| temperature | T | kelvin | $\pu{ K }$ |
| amount of substance | n | mole | $\pu{ mol }$ |
| luminous intensity | L | candela | $\pu{ cd }$ |
The metre is derived from a physical constant (the speed of light) and another SI unit (the second)
