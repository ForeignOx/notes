Consider an object which is initially moving with a [[Velocity]] $u$, and accelerates with a **constant** acceleration $a$, for a time $t$, attaining a final velocity $v$, moving through a [[Displacement]] $s$. 
From the definition of [[Acceleration]], since it is constant, we know:
$$
a=\frac{v-u}{t}\implies v=u+at
$$
We also know that the displacement is the area under a [[Velocity-time graphs|v-t graph]], which will be a trapezium. We can write this:
$$
s=\frac{v+u}{2}t
$$
We can also write the area as a the sum of areas of a rectangle and a triangle:
$$
s=ut+\frac{v-u}{2}t
$$
From the first equation we know $v-u=at$
$$
\therefore s=ut+\frac{1}{2}at^{2}
$$
We can also write the area as a the area of a large rectangle subtract the area of a triangle:
$$
s=vt-\frac{v-u}{2}t
$$
Using the same substitution as before,
$$
s=vt-\frac{1}{2}at^{2}
$$
From the first equation, $t=\frac{v-u}{a}$, which we can substitute into the second equation to get:
$$
s=\frac{1}{2}(u+v) \frac{v-u}{a}\implies v^{2}=u^{2}+2as
$$
We know have 5 equations each missing one variable. 
If the only acceleration acting on an object is that induced by gravity, then the acceleration will be $g$ towards the ground, until an object reaches it's [[Terminal Velocity]]
