A projectile is an object which is made to move obliquely upwards and carries on its path under only the influence of gravity

The horizontal and vertical motion are independent, so we can consider them separately by [[Components of vectors|resolving]]
Horizontal:
$$
x=u\cos\theta t
$$
$$
v\cos \theta=u\cos\theta
$$
Vertical (using [[Uniform Acceleration Equations]]):
$$
v\sin\theta=u\sin\theta -gt
$$
$$
y=\frac{(u+v)\sin\theta}{2}t
$$
$$
y=u\sin\theta t-\frac{1}{2}gt^{2}
$$
$$
y=v\sin \theta t+\frac{1}{2}gt^{2}
$$
$$
(v\sin\theta)^{2}=(u\sin\theta)^{2}-2gy
$$
Note that the total $s$ is known as the range, and $y=0$ at the points A and B. 
Note also that at P, since the gradient is 0, $v\sin\theta=0$
