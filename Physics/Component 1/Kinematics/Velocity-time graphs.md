Velocity-time graphs are a way of representing motion in 1-dimension over time, they are similar to [[Displacement-time graphs]]

The gradient of the line represents [[Acceleration]], a positive gradient represents increase in [[Velocity]], and a negative gradient represents a decrease, if the line is horizontal, then the velocity is constant. The area under the line represents the displacement since $s=\int v \, dt$
