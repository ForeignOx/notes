Static friction is the friction that exists between a stationary object and the surface on which it's resting. For example, an object on a slope might not move as the static friction is equal to the component of the weight opposing it. The maximum value of the static friction before an object begins to move is referred to as the limiting friction. Friction arises from bonds between molecules of the two surfaces in contact. 
The force that opposes the relative motion when one surface slides over another is also called friction - in this case, dynamic friction. It arises from temporary bonds which form as molecules in the surfaces move past one another. When they stretch and break, the stored energy in the bonds is converted to vibrational energy of the molecules, essentially increasing temperature. The value of dynamic friction is typically smaller than the limiting value of grip. This means that once an object starts to slide, it usually accelerates rather than just moving very slowly.
