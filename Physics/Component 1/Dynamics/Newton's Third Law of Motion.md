Whenever one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite force on the first

This can be derived from the [[Law of Conservation of Momentum]] and [[Newton's Second Law of Motion]]:
Consider two isolated bodies $A$ and $B$. $A$ exerts a force on $B$, which we'll call $F_{AB}$. Consider a small time interval $\delta t$, from Newton's second law, body $B$ suffers a change in momentum $\delta p_{B}$ such that:
$$
\delta p_{B}=F_{AB}\delta t
$$
But if the bodies are isolated, then their total momentum, $p_{A}+p_{B}$ is constant, so body $A$ must suffer an equal and opposite momentum $\delta p_{A}$:
$$
\delta p_{A}=-F_{AB}\delta t
$$
Because the momentum of $A$ has changed, it must have a force on it, which can only have been exerted by $B$ (because the bodies are isolated), we can call this $F_{BA}$, which is given by:
$$
F_{BA}=\frac{\delta p_{A}}{\delta t}=-F_{AB}
$$
In other words, the force exerted by body $B$ upon body $A$ is equal and oppositely directed to the force exerted by body $A$ on body $B$ 

Key notes: Newton's third law requires 2 bodies, and the force must be of the same kind (strong, weak, electromagnetic or gravitational)
