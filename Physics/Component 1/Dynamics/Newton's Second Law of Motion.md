The rate of change of [[Momentum]] of a body is directly proportional to the resultant force acting upon it
This implies that the [[Acceleration]] of an object depends on the [[Mass]] of the object and the amount of force applied
For constant mass, this implies $F=ma$
In SI, we define the rate of change of momentum as equal to the force expressed in $\pu{ N }$, so
$$
\sum F=\frac{dp}{d t}
$$
