Air resistance, is one example of viscous drag, or just [[Drag]]. As with [[Friction]] it opposes relative motion between the object and the air it is moving through, it  also exists when the air flows past a stationary object. The mechanism of viscous drag is complicated, but a simplification is that the molecules of air bounce off a moving object slightly faster than they hit it, they gain velocity in the direction the object is moving, so there is a momentum transfer, which means there is a force on the air in the direction of the object's motion, and by [[Newton's Third Law of Motion]], the air exerts an equal and opposite force on the body
