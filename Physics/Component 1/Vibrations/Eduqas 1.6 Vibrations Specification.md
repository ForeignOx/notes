## Overview
This topic covers the physical and mathematical treatment of undamped simple harmonic motion. It investigates the energy interchanges which occur during simple harmonic motion.
## Working Scientifically
The specified practical work in this unit contains opportunities for learners to safely and correctly use a range of practical equipment and materials; to follow written instructions; to make and record observations; to present information and data in a scientific way; to use methods to increase accuracy of measurements, such as timing over multiple oscillations, or use of a fiduciary marker, set square or plumb line.
## Mathematical Skills
There are a number of opportunities for the development of mathematical skills in this unit. These include recognising and making use of appropriate units in calculations; using calculators to handle sin x, cos x, tan x when x is expressed in degrees or radians; finding arithmetic means; identifying uncertainties in measurements and using simple techniques to determine uncertainty when data are combined; translating information between graphical, numerical and algebraic forms; determining the slope and intercept of a linear graph.
## How Science Works
There are opportunities within this topic for learners to use theories, models and ideas to develop scientific explanations; to use appropriate methodology, including ICT, to answer scientific questions and solve scientific problems; to carry out experimental and investigative activities, including appropriate risk management, in a range of contexts; to consider applications and implications of science and evaluate their associated benefits and risks. Learners can investigate the rise and fall of tides and the consequences of resonance. They can consider different methods of preventing vibratory systems resonating and relate this to the design of bridges and the suspension systems of cars.
