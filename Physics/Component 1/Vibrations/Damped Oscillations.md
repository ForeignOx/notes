An oscillatory system is damped if the its [[Free Oscillations]] die away due to resistive forces. For example if a car drives over a small obstacle, the compression in suspension springs is increased. The springs then expand, releasing the excess elastic energy and, in the absence of damping forces the car, would continue oscillating
There are three categories of damping, under damping, over damping and critical damping, the last of which is the aim in designing many structures
## Under damping
As the name might imply, the degree of damping is light. The equation of motion is still in the form $A\cos(\omega t+\epsilon)$, but the amplitude decreases exponentially as $A_{0}e^{ -\lambda t }$, so the resulting equation is:
$$
x=A_{0}e^{ -\lambda t }\cos(\omega t+\epsilon)
$$
Note the that value of $\omega$ is not precisely equal to its value in the absence of damping, but it is very close

Notice that the [[period]] of the oscillation is constant - the time for oscillations does not get shorter as the amplitude decays. Also the amplitude goes down by the same fraction in each cycle
The greater the value of $\lambda$, the more rapidly the amplitude of the oscillations decreases
## Over Damping and Critical Damping
As the degree of damping increases, the system initially returns to equilibrium more quickly

For many purposes, engineers attempt to design systems which are critically damped, as critically damped oscillations converge most rapidly
