![[Simple Pendula 2024-02-27 22.38.32.excalidraw]]
A mass $m$ on a light inextensible string of length $l$ (measured to the centre of mass) executes [[Simple Harmonic Motion]] as long as the amplitude of the oscillations is small (maximum angle of $\theta =5^{\circ}$) 
Ignoring air resistance, there are two forces on the pendulum, the weight $mg$ and the tension $T$ in the string. The mass is constrained to travel along the arc of a circle of radius $l$, the displacement from the centre along this arc, is $x$. Considering the tangential components:
	Component of $T$ along the arc = 0 (radius and tangent are perpendicular)
	Component of $mg$ along the arc $=-mg\sin\theta$
Hence:
$$
ma=-mg\sin\theta
$$
$$
\implies a=-g\sin\theta
$$
By small angle approximations, for small $\theta, \sin\theta=\theta$, and since $\sin\theta=\frac{\text{opp}}{\text{hyp}}=\frac{x}{l}$
$$
a=-\frac{g}{l}x=-\omega^{2}x
$$
Hence
$$
\omega=\sqrt{ \frac{g}{l} }
$$
$$
\implies T=2\pi \sqrt{ \frac{l}{g} }
$$
We can therefore write
$$
x=A\cos(\omega t+\epsilon)
$$
Or
$$
\theta=\theta_{\text{max}}\cos(\omega t+\epsilon)
$$
if the oscillation starts from its maximum positive position, then $\epsilon=0$
