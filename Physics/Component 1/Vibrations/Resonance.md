In a [[Forced Oscillations|forced oscillation]], consider the natural [[frequency]] of oscillation $f_{0}$ and $f$ be the frequency of the driving force
- If $f\ll f_{0}$, the amplitude and phase of the oscillations are the same as that of the driving force
- If $f\gg f_{0}$, the amplitude of the oscillations is very small and the phase is $\pi$
- If $f\sim f_{0}$, the amplitude of the oscillations is very large, and the phase is $\frac{\pi}{2}$ behind the driving force
These can be collated into resonance curves:
