Consider a particle P, which is moving at a constant speed $v$ in a circular path of radius $r$ about a central point O. We measure its linear motion along the circumference from the point X. The angular position, $\theta$ as shown is measured from the line OX
![[Angular Speed 2024-02-09 16.20.32.excalidraw]]
We define the angular speed, $\omega$ as the rate of change of $\theta$ with respect to time
$$
\omega=\frac{d\theta}{dt}
$$
$\omega$ has units $\pu{ rad s-1 }$
We also know by definition that $\theta=\frac{d}{r}$ and since $d=\int v \, dt$, we can say:
$$
d\theta=\frac{ \int v \, dt}{r}\implies\omega=\frac{d\theta}{dt}=\frac{v}{r}
$$
In one revolution, the angular displacement is $2\pi$, we can use this to relate [[Frequency |frequency]] and [[Period|period]] to angular speed, $\omega$:
$$ 
\omega=\frac{2\pi}{T}=2\pi f
$$
