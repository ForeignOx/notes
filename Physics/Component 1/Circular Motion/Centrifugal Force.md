When going round in a circle one might feel a force outwards known as the centrifugal force, this is a fictitious force and arises from your body experiencing the force pair from [[Newton's Third Law of Motion]] due to the [[Centripetal Force]], this misinterpretation arises due to the attempt to use Newton's laws of motion in an accelerated state.
