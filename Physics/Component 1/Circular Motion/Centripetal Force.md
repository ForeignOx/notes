From Newton's [[Newton's First Law of Motion|1st]] and [[Newton's Second Law of Motion|2nd]] laws of motion, we know that if an object is accelerating, the resultant force cannot be 0, from [[Centripetal Acceleration]], we know that the resultant acceleration is acting towards the centre of the circle, we calculate it to be:
$$
F=ma=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}=m\omega^{2}r
$$
