Consider the above diagram, we know the magnitudes of $v$ at A and $v$ at B are equal, so we can construct a vector diagram like so:
![[Centripetal Acceleration 2024-02-19 16.00.43.excalidraw]]
$$
\Delta v=v_{b}-v_{a}=2v\sin\theta
$$
and the arc length AB is equal to $2r\theta$, and the time $\Delta t$ between A and B is given by:
$$
\Delta t=\frac{2r\theta}{v}
$$
Hence the mean acceleration $\bar{a}$ is given by:
$$
\bar{a}=\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}=2v\sin\theta \times \frac{v}{2r\theta}=\frac{v^{2}\sin\theta}{r\theta}
$$
Using the small angle approximation: $\lim_{ \theta \to 0 }\frac{\sin\theta}{\theta}=1$, we can say:
$$
a=\frac{v^{2}}{r}
$$
And using [[Angular Speed]], $v=r\omega$
$$
\implies a=\omega^{2}r
$$
The direction of this acceleration is towards the centre of the circle, hence we call it centripetal acceleration
