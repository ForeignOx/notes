Consider a particle going round a loop the loop:
![[Loop the loop 2024-02-19 16.32.01.excalidraw]]What is the minimum velocity, $v$ to stay in the loop? Consider the critical situation at the top of the curve, the reaction force $R$ and gravity is acting on the particle, and the sum of them is the [[Centripetal Force]]:
$$
\frac{mv^{2}}{r}=mg+R
$$
$R$ cannot be less than 0, so for the car to maintain in contact with the track:
$$
\frac{mv^{2}}{r} \geq mg \implies v\geq \sqrt{ rg }
$$
