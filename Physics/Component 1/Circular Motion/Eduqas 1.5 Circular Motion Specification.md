## Overview
This topic covers the idea that centripetal force is the resultant force that acts on a body moving at constant speed in a circle, and that it acts towards the centre of the circle. Defining terms for circular motion are introduced and the equations relating to circular motion are derived.
## Working Scientifically
This unit contains opportunities for learners to apply scientific knowledge to practical contexts.
## Mathematical Skills
There are a number of opportunities for the development of mathematical skills in this unit. These include using calculators to find and use power expressions; making order of magnitude calculations; understanding and using the symbols:  $=$, $<$, $\ll$, $\gg$, $>$, $\propto$, $\approx$, $\Delta$; changing the subject of an equation, including non-linear equations; using angles in regular 2D and 3D structures.
## Learners should be able to demonstrate and apply their knowledge and understanding of:
- the terms [[Period|period of rotation]], [[Frequency |frequency]]
- the definition of the unit radian as a measure of angle
- the use of the radian as a measure of angle
- the definition of [[Angular Speed|angular velocity]], Ï‰, for an object performing circular motion and performing simple harmonic motion
- the idea that the [[Centripetal Force]] is the resultant force acting on a body moving at constant speed in a circle
- the [[Centripetal Force]] and [[Centripetal Acceleration|acceleration]] are directed towards the centre of the circular motion
- the use of the following equations relating to circular motion:
$$
v=\omega r\text{, }a=\omega^{2}r\text{, }a=\frac{v^{2}}{r}\text{, }F=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}
$$
