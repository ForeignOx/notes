From [[Molecular Motion and Gas Pressure]] we know $pV=\frac{1}{3}Nm \bar{c^{2}}$, which tells us that we can calculate the translational [[Kinetic Energy]] of the molecules if we know just the pressure and volume of a gas: we don't need to know the temperature, the number of molecules or the mass of the molecules, so we can say the translational kinetic energy of the molecules is:
$$
E_{k \text{ trans}}=\frac{1}{2}Nm \bar{c^{2}}=\frac{3}{2}\times \frac{1}{3}Nm \bar{c^{2}}=\frac{3}{2}pV
$$
We can instead write $E_{k \text{ trans}}$ in terms of temperature by using the [[Ideal Gas Equation]] to give:
$$
E_{k \text{ trans}}=\frac{3}{2}nRT
$$
This means that one mole of gas would have translational kinetic energy of $\frac{3}{2}RT$. We can go further and calculate the mean translational kinetic energy per molecule:
$$
\text{Mean KE per molecule}=\frac{1}{2}m \bar{c^{2}}=\frac{3}{2} \frac{R}{N_{A}}T=\frac{3}{2}kT
$$
Where $k$ is known as the Boltzmann constant and has a value of $1.38\times 10^{-23}\pu{ JK-1 }$. Note that this is the mean KE per molecule and if you consider the [[Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution]], you will know that a small fraction of molecules have significantly greater energy
