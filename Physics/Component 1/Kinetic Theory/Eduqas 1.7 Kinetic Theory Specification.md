## Overview
This topic covers the ideal gas law and the equation of state. It develops the kinetic theory of gases and leads to the kinetic theory of pressure of a perfect gas.
# Mathematical Skills
There are a number of opportunities for the development of mathematical skills in this unit. These include recognising and using expressions in decimal and standard form; using ratios, fractions and percentages; making order of magnitude calculations; changing the subject of an equation, including non linear equations; sketching relationships which are modelled by $y=\frac{k}{x}$
## How Science Works
There are opportunities within this topic for learners to use theories, models and ideas to develop scientific explanations. They can investigate how Newton’s laws of motion can be applied to the behaviour of an ideal gas to produce a model which links the pressure of an ideal gas to its density and the root mean square speed of its molecules.
## Learners should be able to demonstrate and apply their knowledge and understanding of:
- the [[Ideal Gas Equation|equation of state for an ideal gas]] expressed as $pV=nRT$ where R is the molar gas constant and $pV=NkT$ where k is the Boltzmann constant
- [[Molecular Energy|the assumptions of the kinetic theory of gases which includes the random distribution of energy among the molecules]]
- the idea that [[Molecular Motion and Gas Pressure|molecular movement causes the pressure exerted by a gas]], and use $p=\frac{1}{3}\rho \bar{c^{2}}=\frac{1}{3} \frac{N}{V}m \bar{c^{2}}$ where $N$ is the number of molecules
- the definition of Avogadro constant $N_{A}$ and hence [[The Mole]]
- the idea that the molar mass $M$ is related to the relative molecular mass $M_{r}$ by $M / \pu{ kg}= \frac{M_{r}}{1000}$, and that the number of moles $n$ is given by $\frac{\text{total mass}}{\text{molar mass}}$
- how to combine $pV=\frac{1}{3}Nm \bar{c^{2}}$ with $pV=nRT$ and show that the [[Molecular Energy|total translational kinetic energy]] of a mole of a monatomic gas is given by $\frac{3}{2}RT$ and the mean kinetic energy of a molecule is $\frac{3}{2}kT$ where $k=\frac{R}{N_{A}}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and that $T$ is proportional to the mean kinetic energy
