## Overview
This topic covers the ideal gas law and the equation of state. It develops the kinetic theory of gases and leads to the kinetic theory of pressure of a perfect gas.
# Mathematical Skills
There are a number of opportunities for the development of mathematical skills in this unit. These include recognising and using expressions in decimal and standard form; using ratios, fractions and percentages; making order of magnitude calculations; changing the subject of an equation, including non linear equations; sketching relationships which are modelled by $y=\frac{k}{x}$
## How Science Works
There are opportunities within this topic for learners to use theories, models and ideas to develop scientific explanations. They can investigate how Newtonâ€™s laws of motion can be applied to the behaviour of an ideal gas to produce a model which links the pressure of an ideal gas to its density and the root mean square speed of its molecules.
## Learners should be able to demonstrate and apply their knowledge and understanding of:
- the [[Ideal Gas Equation|equation of state for an ideal gas]] expressed as $pV=nRT$ where R is the molar gas constant and $pV=NkT$ where k is the Boltzmann constant
- [[Molecular Energy|the assumptions of the kinetic theory of gases which includes the random distribution of energy among the molecules]]
- the idea that [[Molecular Motion and Gas Pressure|molecular movement causes the pressure exerted by a gas]], and use $p=\frac{1}{3}\rho \bar{c^{2}}=\frac{1}{3} \frac{N}{V}m \bar{c^{2}}$ where $N$ is the number of molecules
- the definition of Avogadro constant $N_{A}$ and hence [[the mole]]
- the idea that the molar mass $M$ is related to the relative molecular mass $M_{r}$ by $M / \pu{ kg}= \frac{M_{r}}{1000}$, and that the number of moles $n$ is given by $\frac{\text{total mass}}{\text{molar mass}}$
- how to combine $pV=\frac{1}{3}Nm \bar{c^{2}}$ with $pV=nRT$ and show that the [[Molecular Energy|total translational kinetic energy]] of a mole of a monatomic gas is given by $\frac{3}{2}RT$ and the mean kinetic energy of a molecule is $\frac{3}{2}kT$ where $k=\frac{R}{N_{A}}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and that $T$ is proportional to the mean kinetic energy
