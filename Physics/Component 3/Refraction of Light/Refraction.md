Refraction is the change of direction of travel of a [[Progressive Waves|wave]] when its [[Speed]] of travel changes, for example when it passes from one material into another

In the above image, the waves are crossing a boundary into a region in which they travel more slowly. The rays show the direction of travel of the rays and are at right angles to the [[Wavefronts]]. As each wave crosses the boundary, it slows down; the lower end of the wave slows down first so the line of the wave becomes more horizontal (more nearly parallel to the boundary). Hence the direction of travel of the waves becomes more nearly vertical
As the lines represent wavefronts, the separation of the lines is the [[Wavelength]], which clearly decreases as it crosses the boundary. Since every wave that passes through one side of the boundary passes the other side, the [[Frequency]] of the wave is unchanged
