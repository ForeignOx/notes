If a [[Progressive Waves|wave]] strikes a smooth (polished) boundary between two media, it is usually partially reflected and partially [[refraction|refracted]]

The diagram is drawn for $n_{1}>n_{2}$, but the same holds for $n_{1}<n_{2}$. Note that the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence
The fraction of the incident power which is reflected depends upon both the angle of incidence and the [[refractive index|refractive indices]] of the two materials:
- The greater the angle of incidence, the greater the power reflected
- The greater the difference in refractive indices, the greater the power reflected
