Optical fibres are used for data transmission, regional networks and long-distance network. They are also used in remote imaging systems, such as internal medical examinations and investigating inaccessible locations such as drains and collapsed buildings
## Multimode Optical Fibres
In a typical stepped-[[Refractive Index|index]] optical fibre consists of a single glass thread, the central part of which (the core) carries the light signal and the outer part (the cladding) keeps the signal in the core. Around this is a protective layer of plastic called the coating
The optical fibre relies for its operation on [[total internal reflection]] of light rays at the boundary between the core and the lower refracgtive index cladding

All light rays that are incident upon the core cladding boundary at angles greater than the critical angle are totally internally reflected back into the core. They then repeatedly hit opposite sides of the core at the same angle being reflected each time and emerge from the other end of the fibre (unless they are absorbed or scattered by impurities in the glass). The optical fibre is not necessarily perfectly straight, but any reasonable curvature of the cable will hardly affect the angles of the multiple reflections. This kind of fibre is fine for short-distance communication or imaging applications, but it runs into a problem for digital communication over long distances with rapid switching rates in that beams that have come in at angles and beams that go straight through can take different amounts of time, so the signals can get merged and corrupted. This is known as data degradation and is because of multimode dispersion
## Monomode Optical Fibres
Monomode fibres use glass with a variable refractive index that bends the light into a straight line so that there is no multimode dispersion
Progressive signal loss due to attenuation becomes the main problem to be overcome in monomode systems in boosting transmission rates and distances. For near internal reflection wavelengths, this is mainly due to scattering by impurities in the glass of the fibre. This process is called Rayleigh scattering and becomes more serious the shorter the wavelength. This is the same effect that produces the blue of the sky. Some molecules and ions in the glass also selectively absorb particular wavelengths
