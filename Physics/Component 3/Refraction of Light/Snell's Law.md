When a [[Progressive Waves|wave]] is [[Refraction|refracted]], there is a relationship between the [[Speed|speeds]] before and after the boundary and the angles it refracts at:
![[Snell's Law 2024-04-09 12.58.06.excalidraw]]
If we consider instead of rays, [[Wavefronts]], the same diagram would look something like:
![[Snell's Law 2024-04-09 13.01.55.excalidraw]]
$PR$ represents a wavefront arriving at the boundary with an angle of incidence $\theta_{1}$. $QS$ represents the position of the same wavefront, a time $\Delta t$ later, at the instant in which point $P$ on the incident wavefront arrives at the boundary
In triangle $PQR$, $QR=\frac{PQ}{\sin\theta_{1}}$, In triangle $QRS$, $QR=\frac{RS}{\sin\theta_{2}}$, we can equate these to get:
$$
\frac{PQ}{\sin\theta_{1}}=\frac{RS}{\sin\theta_{2}}
$$
But we know $PQ=v_{1}\Delta t$ and $RS=v_{2}\Delta t$, therefore:
$$
\frac{v_{1}\Delta t}{\sin\theta_{1}}=\frac{v_{2}\Delta t}{\sin\theta_{2}}
$$
$$
\implies \frac{\sin\theta_{1}}{v_{1}}=\frac{\sin\theta_{2}}{v_{2}}
$$
This can be rewritten using the definition of the [[Refractive Index]]:
$$
\frac{n_{1}\sin\theta_{1}}{c}=\frac{n_{2}\sin\theta_{2}}{c}
$$
$$
\implies n_{1}\sin\theta_{1}=n_{2}\sin\theta_{2}
$$
This is Snell's Law
