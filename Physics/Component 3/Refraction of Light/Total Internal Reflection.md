A special form of [[reflection]] is total internal reflection, which is when the angle of [[refraction]] is perpendicular to the normal. The minimum angle at which this occurs is known as the critical angle, $\theta_{c}$

Since $\sin 90^{\circ}=1$, we can use [[Snell's Law]] to get:
$$
n_{1}\sin\theta_{c}=n_{2}
$$
