The refractive index, $n$, of a material is defined by:
$$
n=\frac{c}{v}
$$
Where $v$ and $c$ are the [[speed|speeds]] of a [[Progressive Waves|wave]] in the material and a vacuum respectively
Because waves travel more slowly through materials than through a vacuum, $n\geq 1$, since $n=1$ for a vacuum
