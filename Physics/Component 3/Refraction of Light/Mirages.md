The reflection of light, apparently from a shimmering water surface on a hot summer road or from a non-existent lake in the desert, is known as a mirage (inferior mirage) This happens because the road (or desert) surface absorbs radiation from the Sun and heats up. This warms the air in contact with the surface so that there is a temperature inversion - the air temperature falls with height. The [[refractive index]] decreases as a light ray approaches the road surface and, if the ray travels at a glancing angle, there is enough of a difference to cause [[total internal reflection]]
