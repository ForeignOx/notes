Consider two [[Progressive Waves|wave]] sources, $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$, we can predict where there will be [[interference]] using path difference by working out at which point in a [[wavelength]] two waves are, using [[Phase of Oscillation|phase]]. If they are in phase, there will be constructive interference, if they are in antiphase, there will be destructive interference

The general rules for waves from in phase sources are:
For constructive interference at a point $X$, the path difference, 
$$
|S_{1}X-S_{2}X|=n\lambda, n\in\mathbb{N}
$$
For destructive interference at a point $X$, the path difference,
$$
|S_{1}X-S_{2}X|=\left( n+\frac{1}{2} \right)\lambda, n \in\mathbb{N}
$$
If $X$ is situated far enough away from $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$, the path difference can be estimated using the following:
$$
S_{2}X-S_{1}X\approx a\sin\theta
$$
