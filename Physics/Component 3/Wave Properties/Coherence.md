Two or more sources are called coherent if there is a constant [[Phase of Oscillation|phase]] relationship between their oscillations
A beam of coherent light is nearly monochromatic, that is a continuous stream of oscillations of a single [[frequency]], and has [[wavefronts]] extending across its width, as if it came from a point source
