Diffraction is the spreading of [[Progressive Waves|waves]] round obstacles in their way. We shall concentrate on diffraction around edges of a slit. When the slit's width is less than or equal to the [[Wavelength]], the diffracted [[Wavefronts]] at some distance from the slit are more or less semi-circular although the [[Amplitude]] is greater in the middle than at the edges

When the slit width is several times greater than the wavelength, there is a main or central beam of diffracted waves that spreads through only a small angle either side of the the 'straight through' direction. There are also 'side' beams of much smaller amplitude than the main beam

Diffraction can be understood using the concept of wavelets. We say that each point on a wavefront behaves like a point source, sending out low amplitude wavelets in all 'forward' directions, so that, in section, their wavefronts are semicircles, which when combined make an almost semi-circular shape

When the slit width is not small compared with the wavelength, we instead change the model to think of each point as an oscillating source of wavelets of wavelength $\lambda$. We find the displacement at any point, $P$, 'ahead' of the slit by applying the [[Principle of Superposition of Waves]] of the wavelets arriving there
For a slit of width much less than $\lambda$, there is no point $P$ at which the [[Path Difference]] amounts to $\frac{\lambda}{2}$ for any two points in the gap, which is why the wave spreads all the way round. It turns out that even for a slit as wide as $\lambda$, there is destructive [[Interference]] for wavelets from all the points in the gap added together only for $P$ at a right angle to the normal, so the waves just manage to spread right around
For slit widths between $\lambda$ and $2\lambda$, larger path differences are possible, and overall destructive interference occurs at an angle of less than $90^{\circ}$ to the normal. At larger angles there is net constructive interference, but the resultant interference occurs for the first time at smaller and smaller angles, so there is less and less spreading of the main beam. There are also more and more weak 'side beams' that are caused by constructive interference separated by 'channels' of destructive interference
