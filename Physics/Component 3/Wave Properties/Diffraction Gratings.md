At its simplest, a diffraction grating is a flat plate, which is opaque except for thousands of straight, parallel, equally-spaced slits. For a grating to be used with visible light, the distance, $d$, between the centres of adjacent slits is typically a number of micrometres. The makers supply the value of $d$
We shall assume that light is shone normally (at right angles) on to the grating, so that the slits act as in-[[Phase of Oscillation|phase]] sources. Each slit is very narrow, so the [[Diffraction|diffracted]] [[Wavefronts]] are almost semicircular

Now consider the light arriving at a distant point, $P$, from each slit. The light paths from the slits to $P$ will be almost parallel, so the [[Path Difference]] between light from adjacent slits will be $d\sin\theta$, which we can see from a right-angled triangle

The condition for constructive interference at $P$ is therefore
![[Diffraction Gratings 2024-04-08 20.45.54.excalidraw|640x280]]
$$
d\sin\theta_{n}=n\lambda, n\in\mathbb{N}
$$
Note that this is only valid for $d\ll a$
So in the grating, light from each slit will reach the distant point in phase with light from its neighbour. Therefore light from all slits will arrive there in phase. So the same constructive [[Interference]] condition applies however many slits there are. Now take an angle $\theta$, which is slightly larger than $\theta_{1}$, there would eventually be a path difference in the form of $\left( n+\frac{1}{2} \right)\lambda$ causing destructive interference, so the light from all slits except the ones that constructively interfere, will completely destructively interfere, meaning this grating produces a series of dots
