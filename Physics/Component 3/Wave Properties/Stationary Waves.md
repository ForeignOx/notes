If we consider a [[Progressive Waves|progressive wave]] propagating though a string with an end that has been fixed, when the wave reaches the end, it will reflect and travel back down along the string, which will cause [[interference]] which will create a stationary wave. These look like this:

Essentially we see a half cycle of oscillation, starting with the string in an extreme position, and then moving to the opposite and back. The points which are always stationary, are called nodes. The points with maximum motion midway between the nodes are the antinodes. The internodal distance is the distance between the nodes of a stationary wave, it is $\frac{\lambda}{2}$
## Differences Between Stationary Waves and Progressive Waves
In a stationary wave, all points between a pair of neighbouring nodes oscillate in phase; points either side of a node oscillate in antiphase. In a progressive wave, there is a gradual change of phase along the wave
In a progressive wave, all points oscillate with the same amplitude. In a stationary wave, the amplitude of vibration varies smoothly from zero (at the nodes) to a maximum at the antinodes
## Stationary Waves in Air columns
If you blow across the open top of a tube or pipe, [[Longitudinal Waves|longitudinal]] stationary waves are set up in the air column. Unlike in a string, the stationary wave has an antinode at the open end. The first few [[harmonics]] are shown below:
