When light passes through two parallel slits close together one can observe a pattern of light and dark 'fringes' on a screen placed some distance from the slits

The slits essentially act as in-[[Phase of Oscillation|phase]] sources

There will be a bright fringe at $O$. Let the first off-axis bright fringe be at $P$. Then the [[path difference]] $S_{2}P-S_{1}P=\lambda$, where $\lambda$  is the [[wavelength]]. Since $P$ is far from the slits, the two lines are essentially parallel, so we can say $a\sin\theta=\lambda$, where $\theta$ is a small angle. We know that $\tan\theta=\frac{y}{D}$, and since it is a small angle, $\tan\theta \approx\theta \approx \sin\theta$, so we can say:
$$
\frac{\lambda}{a}=\frac{y}{D}
$$
$$
\implies \lambda=\frac{ay}{D}
$$
This is only true as long as $a\ll D$ and $y\ll D$
