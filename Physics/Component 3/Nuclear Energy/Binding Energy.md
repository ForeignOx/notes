The binding [[energy]] of a system is the energy required to separate the particles of the system. The binding energy of a nucleus is the energy required to disassemble the nucleus into its constituent protons and neutrons
We can use the measured masses of the particles and [[Mass-Energy|$E=mc^2$]] to calculate the nuclear binding energy for any nucleus as follows:
1. Calculate the [[mass]] deficit, $\Delta m$ of the nucleus. The nuclear mass is less than the sums of the masses of the individual protons and neutrons. The difference is the mass deficit
2. calculate the binding energy using $E=\Delta mc^{2}$
## Binding Energy per Nucleon
Imagine building up stable nuclei by adding more and more nucleons (protons and neutrons). As each extra nucleon is added, the binding energy must increase. If it didn't, that extra nucleon would not be bound to the others. Hence, we'd expect the binding energy of stable nuclei to increase with nucleon number, which is generally what we find. However, to determine how tightly the individual nucleons are bound we need to calculate the binding energy per nucleon:
$$
\text{BE/nucleon}=\frac{\text{binding energy}}{\text{nucleon number}}
$$
## Nuclear Binding Energy Curve
The extraction energy by splitting or merging nuclei (i.e. [[Nuclear Fission|fission]] or [[Nuclear Fusion|fusion]]) is made possible by the form of the binding energy curve: the plot of binding energy per nucleon against nucleon number

An obvious feature is that for the elements up to iron, there is a positive correlation of binding energy per nucleon against nucleon number: as we go along the periodic table up to iron, the nuclei become more and more stable. Past nickel, the nuclei stability decreases with $A$
Another obvious feature is the spike at $A=4$ which represents $\ce{ ^4_{2}He }$. This nuclide is particularly tightly bound. There are also smaller spikes at $A=12,16,20$: the nuclides $\ce{ ^12_{6}C, ^16_{8}O, ^20_{10}Ne }$ which are multiples of the $\ce{ ^4_{2}He }$ structure
As we can see, the elements to the left of iron tend to undergo nuclear fusion, while the elements to the right of iron tend to undergo nuclear fission
