The island of stability, aka $N-Z$ stability plot below gives lots of information about nuclear stability
![[image(2).png]]
- There are no stable nuclei with more than 83 protons
- The ratio of neutrons to protons in stable light nuclei is very close to 1. For heavier stable nuclei, the ratio increases with $Z$
- Nuclides above the line of stability are [[Beta Decay|$\ce{ \beta- }$]] unstable, below the line is the $\ce{ \beta+ }$ instability region
Apart from $\ce{ ^1_{1}H }$, all stable nuclei contain neutrons; combinations of more than one proton are never stable as protons are positively charged, so repel one another according to [[Coulomb's Law]]. All hadrons attract at short distances with the [[Nuclear Force]]. The strong force can only stabilise groups of nucleons if there are uncharged neutrons as well as protons. Because of the Coulomb repulsion of the protons, their energy levels are further apart than those of neutrons. For stability against $\beta$ decay, the highest occupied neutron and proton energy levels must be approximately the same, so a stable nucleus needs to have more neutrons than protons. For nuclei with more than 83 protons, the separation between protons on opposite sides of the nucleus is such that the nuclear force cannot overcome the Coulomb repulsion, whatever the number of neutrons. Hence, there are no stable nuclei with $Z>83$
