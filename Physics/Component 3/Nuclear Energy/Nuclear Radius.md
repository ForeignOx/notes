The discovery of the atomic nucleus by Rutherford, Geiger and Marsden was by the scattering of [[Alpha Decay|$\alpha$]] particles by gold atoms. The number of alpha particles, $N$, of [[kinetic energy]] $E_{k}$, scattered from the gold nuclei was found to depend upon the angle of scattering, $\theta$, according to:
$$
N\propto \frac{1}{E_{k}^{2}\sin ^{4}\left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)}
$$
which is in agreement with the mathematical predictions for a point nucleus. From this, we can calculate an upper limit for the size of a gold nucleus by considering the head on collision of an alpha particle (Z=2) with a gold nucleus (Z=79). Assuming a $5\pu{ MeV}$ alpha particle, the [[Electrical Potential Energy|electrostatic potential energy]] at the closest point of approach is $5\pu{ MeV}=8.0\times 10^{-13}\pu{ J}$, we can ignore the recoil of the gold nucleus as it makes little difference to the outcome. Applying the potential energy formula:
$$
8.0\times 10^{-13}=\frac{2\times 79\times (1.6\times 10^{-19})^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}d}
$$
$$
\implies d=4.6\times 10^{-14}\pu{ m}
$$
So we conclude that the radius of the gold nucleus must be less than this. Later experiments with accelerated alpha particles showed a departure from the Rutherford formula above about $25\pu{ MeV}$, which leads to an estimate of $9\times 10^{-15}\pu{ m}$. The most accurate measurements are made using the [[diffraction]] of high-energy electrons from nuclei
