The [[binding energy]] curve shows that, if we combine low mass nuclei, the resulting nucleus is more tightly bound, so we obtain an [[energy]] output. The simplest possible reaction is:
$$
\ce{ ^1_{1}H +^1_{1}H -> ^2_{1}H +e+ +\nu_{e} }
$$
This reaction has several drawbacks: it is relatively low yield ($2\pu{ MeV}$ including the subsequent $\ce{ e+e- }$ [[Antiparticle-Particle Annihilation|annihilation]]), energy is lost in the [[Neutrinos|neutrino]] and it is a [[Weak Force|weak interaction]] (and is therefore unlikely to occur). This last point is the most serious. This reaction is the base of the proton-proton chain in the Sun, where an individual proton in the core has a lifetime of about $10^{9}$ [[Year|years]] before making a successful collision
A more promising reaction is:
$$
\ce{ ^2_{1}H +^3_{1}H -> ^4_{2}He +n }
$$
where $\ce{ ^3_{1}H }$ is tritium, consisting of a proton and two neutrons. Approximately $1.5$ atoms in $10^{4}$ of hydrogen is deuterium, so it is present in large amounts in sea-water. Tritium needs to be made artificially using [[nuclear fission]] of $\ce{ ^6_{3}Li }$
This reaction is controlled by the [[Strong Force|strong interaction]] and so, as long as we can bring the reactants close enough together ($\sim 3\pu{ fm}$), they should fuse. The problem is that they are both positively charged, so we have to overcome the [[Coulomb's Law|Coulomb]] repulsion. This means raising the reactants to a high temperature. We can estimate the temperature needed as follows:
Assume the nuclei need to be brought to $3\pu{ fm}$. The [[Electrical Potential Energy|potential energy]] is:
$$
E_{p}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{r}=9\times 10^{9} \frac{(1.6\times 10^{-19})^{2}}{3\times 10^{-15}}=8\times 10^{-14}\pu{ J}
$$
In order to achieve this, the thermal energy of the reactants needs to be half this. So, using the equation for [[molecular energy]], $E_{k}=\frac{3}{2}kT$, for the mean [[kinetic energy]] to be this high needs:
$$
T=\frac{2}{3} \frac{E_{k}}{k}=\frac{2}{3} \frac{4\times 10^{-14}\pu{ J}}{1.38\times 10^{-23}\pu{ J K-1}} \approx 2\times 10^{9}\pu{ K}
$$
Actually, we don't need 2 billion kelvin because we don't need the mean kinetic energy to be this high, we just need a small, but significant fraction to have this. Engineers have achieved temperatures of $10^{8}\pu{ K}$ and observed fusion taking place
