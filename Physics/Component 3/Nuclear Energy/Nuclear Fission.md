Some high mass [[Nuclide|nuclides]] can undergo [[spontaneous fission]]. The only [[primordial nuclide]], which can decay this way, is $\ce{ ^235_{92}U }$. This nuclide decays almost 100% by [[Alpha Decay|$\alpha$]] emission, but in $7$ out of $10^{11}$ decays the nucleus splits into two large fission fragments and several neutrons:
$$
\ce{ ^235_{92}U -> ^125_{50}Sn +^107_{42}Mo +3n }
$$
The two decay products are both [[Beta Decay|$\ce{ \beta- }$]] radioactive. This is because they have an excess of neutrons
If a $\ce{ ^235_{92}U }$ nucleus absorbs a neutron, the nucleus is likely to split in a process called [[induced fission]]. This is much more likely to happen with [[thermal neutrons]]. Fast neutrons are much less likely to induce fission. A chain reaction is possible, in which the neutrons from fission events go on to produce further fissions. This can be:
- A controlled chain reaction, in, for example, a nuclear reactor, in which excess neutrons are absorbed by control rods so that only an average of one emitted neutron goes on to induce further fission and the neutrons are slowed down (thermalised) by a moderator and the energy extracted as heat
- An uncontrolled chain reaction in, for example, a nuclear weapon
The [[energy]] released in nuclear fission can be calculated by the difference in the [[binding energy]] of the reactants and the fission products
The immediate energy release is divided up as:
- ~83% as [[kinetic energy]] of the decay products
- ~2.5% as kinetic energy of fast neutrons
- ~3.5% as gamma rays
This energy (~89% of the total) becomes the [[internal energy]] of the surrounding material. The remaining 11% is emitted over time in the beta decay of the neutron rich decay products, of which about half is in the [[Neutrinos|electron antineutrinos]]. There is a huge range of half-lives in the fission products, from the milliseconds to several $10^{5}$ [[Year|years]]. The spent fuel rods need keeping in cooling ponds until the short-lived fission products have decayed
One possible fission event of low mass particles is by exposing $\ce{ ^6_{3}Li }$ to neutrons:
$$
\ce{ ^6_{3}Li + n-> ^4_{2}He +^3_{1}H }
$$
This is because of the spike on the binding energy curve at helium
