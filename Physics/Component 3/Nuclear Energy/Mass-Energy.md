In developing his special theory of relativity, Einstein concluded that [[Mass]] and [[Energy]] are two aspects of the same quantity, which we call mass-energy and that this quantity is conserved, i.e. the [[Principle of Conservation of Energy]]. We can express mass-energy in units of mass or units of energy, the exchange rate between them being $c^{2}$, where $c$ is the [[Speed]] of light in a vacuum, so:
$$
E=mc^{2}
$$
