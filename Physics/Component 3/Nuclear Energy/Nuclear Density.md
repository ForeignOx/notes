The mass of the nucleus depend on $A$, the nucleon number - as they all have virtually the same [[Mass]], $m$:
$$
\text{Nuclear Mass}=Am
$$
Assuming the nucleus is spherical, we have a volume:
$$
V=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}
$$
Using the equation for [[Density]],
$$
\rho=\frac{M}{V}=\frac{Am}{\frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}}
$$
$$
\implies \rho=\frac{3Am}{4\pi r^{3}}
$$
So we can say that the density is proportional to $\frac{A}{r^{3}}$
