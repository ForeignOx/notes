A charged particle in a [[uniform electric field]] moves in a [[Motion of Charged Particle in Uniform Electric Field|straight or parabolic path with changing speed]], but a charged particle injected into a [[Uniform Magnetic Fields|uniform magnetic field]] [[Magnetic Fields on Moving Charges|moves in a straight, helical or circular path at constant speed]]. If we apply both $E$ and $B$ fields over the same region, a particle's trajectory is likely to be complicated, but we consider just one simple case:
Suppose $E$ and $B$ fields are at right angles to each other. A set-up for this is shown below:
![[Crossed Electric and Magnetic Fields in a Vacuum 2024-04-15 22.39.46.excalidraw]]
A charged particle is sent into the 'crossed fields'. If the fields are as shown (or if both fields are reversed) the electric and magnetic forces on the particle will be in opposite directions. For zero resultant, their magnitudes must be equal:
$$
Bqv=Eq
$$
$$
\implies Bv=E
$$
This is the condition for the particle to continue moving in a straight line at constant [[speed]], even though there are fields present. This gives us a neat way of measuring the speed of the particles in a beam of charged particles: send the beam normally through crossed fields and adjust the field strengths until the beam is undeflected. Then $v=\frac{E}{B}$. A very similar use is a '[[velocity]] filter': the ratio $\frac{E}{B}$ is set at a desired value, so if particles of various speeds are sent normally through the crossed fields, only those with speed $\frac{E}{B}$ will go straight through
