When drawing the direction of [[vector quantities]] in 3-Dimensions, we use these symbols:
![[Dots and Crosses (for Vectors) 2024-04-15 15.59.29.excalidraw]]
The dot means the arrow of the direction of the vector is coming towards us, out of the 'page' and the cross (based on the tail-feathers of an arrow), means instead that it is going into the page
