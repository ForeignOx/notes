A striking feature of the [[magnetic flux density]] inside a [[Magnetic Field due to a Current in a Circuit|long solenoid]] is that, for given $n$ and $I$, it doesn't depend on the cross-sectional area, $A$. But, in a way, with a larger $A$ you do get more [[Magnetic Fields|field]] for your money even if the field is no stronger. We can make this idea more precise by defining the quantity of magnetic flux, $\Phi$:
The magnetic flux, $\Phi$, through an area, $A$ is defined by $\Phi=BA\cos\phi$, in which $\phi$ is the angle between the normal to the area and the flux desity. It is a [[Scalar Quantities|scalar]]

We can now see the sense in calling $B$ the flux density, because, writing $B_{\perp}=B\cos \phi$ for the component of the flux density normal to the area:
$$
B_{\perp}=\frac{\Phi}{A}
$$
which is equal to the normal flux per unit area. The properties of [[magnetic field lines]] are connected with 'conservation of magnetic flux'. An example is given below

All the flux that passes to the right through the disc-shaped area $A_{\text{int}}$ 'returns' leftward through area $A_\text{ext}$, an imaginary annulus surrounding the solenoid and extending indefinitely. The flux densty, on the other hand, varies over $A_\text{ext}$ and is everywhere much less than over $A_\text{int}$
