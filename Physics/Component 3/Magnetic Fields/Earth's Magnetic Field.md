The Earth's [[Magnetic Fields|magnetic field]] is believed to be generated by the motion of molten iron-rich material in the Earth's core. On a large scale, the pattern of the Earth's [[Magnetic Field Lines|field lines]] is quite similar to the pattern that would arise from a small but very strong magnet near the centre of the 
Earth and aligned at a few degrees to the Earth's axis of rotation. The field is not [[Uniform Magnetic Fields|uniform]] on a large scale. At near-polar latitudes, the field lines are close together. They also pass through the upper atmosphere, where the fast-moving particles that they have captured may collide with molecules, [[Atomic Energy Levels|exciting them]]. The light [[Emission Spectra|emitted]] [[Spontaneous Photon Emission|during de-excitation]] is a major cause of the Northern and Southern 'lights (aurora borealis and aurora australis)
