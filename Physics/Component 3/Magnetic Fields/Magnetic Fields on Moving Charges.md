Since a [[Electric Current|current]] in a metal wire is made up of moving free electrons, it seems likely that the [[motor effect]] force on a current-carrying wire is simply equal to the sum of forces acting on the individual moving electrons. If so, we can easily find the magnetic force on an electron with [[drift velocity]] $v$:
![[Magnetic Fields on Moving Charges 2024-04-15 18.58.43.excalidraw]]
Firstly, we know that if the wire has cross-sectional area $A$ and has $n$ free electrons per unit volume, then the current will be:
$$
I=nAve
$$
We can therefore write the motor effect force on length $l$ of the wire as:
$$
F_\text{wire}=BIl\sin\theta=BnAvel\sin\theta
$$
But the volume of the wire is $Al$, so there are $nAl$ free electrons in it. Therefore, force on each free electron is given by:
$$
F=\frac{BnAve\sin\theta}{nAl}=Bev\sin\theta
$$
We can now make the leap that this applies to any particle carrying [[Electric Charge|charge]] $q$, provided we replace $e$ with $q$. So...
The magnetic force on a charge $q$, moving in a magnetic field as shown
![[Magnetic Fields on Moving Charges 2024-04-15 20.07.45.excalidraw]]
Has magnitude:
$$
F=Bqv\sin\theta
$$

The direction of the force is given by [[Fleming's left hand motor rule]]
## Path of a Charged Particle Moving in a [[Uniform Magnetic Fields|Uniform Magnetic Field]]
Suppose that a charge, $q$, moving at speed $v$ is 'injected' into a uniform magnetic field, $B$, with angle $\theta$ between the directions of the field and the particle [[velocity]]. Assuming no other forces other than the magnetic force are acting on the particle, we can predict its path.
First, note that the magnetic (motor effect) force is always at right angles to the particle's direction of motion. Therefore, the field can't do [[work]] on the particle. Its [[kinetic energy]], hence its [[speed]], remain constant. Instead, the force causes the particle's direction of motion to change at a constant rate. 
### $\theta=0$
If $\theta=0$, there will be no force, so the particle will carry on moving parallel to the field lines, at speed $v$
### $\theta=90^{\circ}$
If, initially the particle is moving at right angles to the field, it will continue to do so, in a circular path. The motor effect force supplies the [[centripetal acceleration]], so it's easy to find the radius of the circle, using [[Newton's Second Law of Motion]]:
$$
F=ma
$$
$$
\implies Bqv=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}
$$
$$
\implies r=\frac{mv}{Bq}
$$
### $\theta$ is neither $0$ nor $90^{\circ}$
We can resolve the particle's velocity into a [[Components of vectors|component]] $v_{\parallel}=v\cos\theta$ parallel to the field direction and a component $v_{\perp}=v\sin\theta$ at right angles to it
![[Magnetic Fields on Moving Charges 2024-04-15 20.43.13.excalidraw]]
By themselves, $v_{\perp}$ would give circular motion, and $v_{\parallel}$, unaffected by the field, would give straight line motion parallel to the [[Magnetic Field Lines|field lines]]. A combination of these two motions results: the particle traces out, at a constant speed, a helix as shown above
Paths resembling helices are traced out by charged particles, mainly protons and electrons emitted by the Sun, that are trapped by the Earth's magnetic field and condemned to gyrate around field lines
