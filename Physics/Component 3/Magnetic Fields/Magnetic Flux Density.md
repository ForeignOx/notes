Magnetic flux density (or [[Magnetic Fields|magnetic field]] strength) is a [[Vectors|vector]] of magnitude:
$$
B=\frac{F_\text{max}}{Il}
$$
Where $F_\text{max}$ is the force on a short wire of length $l$, carrying a [[Electric Current|current]] $I$, angled so as to maximise the force on it. It has units: $\pu{ N A-1  m-1=T}$ where $\pu{ T}$ is the Tesla. The direction of the vector is given by [[Fleming's Left Hand Motor Rule]], knowing the force and current directions
