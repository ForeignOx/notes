A steady [[Electric Current|current]] requires a complete conducting circuit. We find that the circuit produces a [[Magnetic Fields|magnetic field]] and that the [[Magnetic Field Lines|lines of flux]] are linked with the circuit in the same topological way that handles of keys are linked with a key ring
![[Magnetic Field due to a Current in a Circuit 2024-04-16 20.14.10.excalidraw]]
The direction of the field is given by the [[right hand grip rule]]. The rule can be applied all round the circuit; it's natural to suppose that each part of the circuit is contributing to the magnetic field. The [[Magnetic Flux Density|flux density]] at any point in the vicinity is the vector sum of flux densities due to all the little bits of the circuit
## Magnetic Field due to a Current in a Long Straight Wire
The wire will have to be part of a circuit, of course, but we shall consider the field only in a region which is close to the wire and far from both the ends of the straight part and the rest of the circuit. The field looks something like:
![[Magnetic Field due to a Current in a Circuit 2024-04-16 20.55.00.excalidraw]]
The current, $I$, needs to be large enough for the wire's field to be much greater than the [[Earth's Magnetic Field|Earth's]]. The [[Magnetic Field Lines|field lines]] are circles around the wire. The magnitude of the flux density, $B$, can be investigated with a [[Hall Effect|Hall probe]], oriented at each point to give a maximum hall voltage. We find that for points at various distance, $r$, from the centre of the wire, $B\propto \frac{1}{r}$, so doubling $r$ halves $B$, and so on: inverse proportionality. We also find that at any given point, $B \propto I$ and are represented by the equation:
$$
B=\frac{\mu_{0}I}{2\pi r}
$$
Where $\mu_{0}$ is the permeability of free space and has a value of $\mu_{0}=4\pi \times 10^{-7}\pu{ H m-1}$
If there is only a small current in a vertical wire, its field strength a few centimetres away will be comparable with the horizontal component, $B_{EH}$, of the Earth's magnetic field, the resultant field is shown
![[Magnetic Field due to a Current in a Circuit 2024-04-16 21.39.44.excalidraw]]
Point $X$ is a null point, where the (horizontal) field strength is 0
## The Magnetic Field due to a Current in a Coil (Long Solenoid)
Where the field lines pass through the plane of the loop, the fields due to all parts of the loop are in the same direction, and vector addition leads to reinforcement. We can make the field here $N$ times stronger still, by replacing the loop with a coil of $N$ turns of insulated wire, giving, effectively, $N$ times the loop current
If we use a Hall probe to measure the field along the axis of a 'flat' circular current-carrying coil, we find that it varies with distance $z$ from the centre of the coil
![[Magnetic Field due to a Current in a Circuit 2024-04-16 22.11.26.excalidraw]]
We now concentrate on the solenoid, a coil whose turns are wound in a close packed helix, usually around a 'former' in the shape of a tube. Field lines due to current in a long solenoid ($\text{length}\gg \text{diameter}$) are shown below:
![[Magnetic Field due to a Current in a Circuit 2024-04-16 22.23.34.excalidraw]]
Note that:
- The field lines are closed loops, and the pattern resembles that of a bar magnet with its north pole near the solenoid's right-hand end. North because, with the current as shown, the field lines emerge from the right, according to the right-hand grip rule
- Inside the long solenoid, except near the ends, the field is almost [[Uniform Magnetic Fields|uniform]] over the cross-section and along the solenoid. Its magnitude is given by: 
$$
B=\mu_{0}nI
$$
$$
n=\frac{\text{Number of turns}}{\text{Axial length}}=\frac{N}{L}
$$
- The same equation gives the flux density inside a toroidal coil, provided that the 'tube' radius is much less than the overall radius of the torus

### Use of an Iron Core in a Coil
We can greatly increase the flux density (and the [[Magnetic Flux|flux]]) in a solenoid by including a soft iron core
![[Magnetic Field due to a Current in a Circuit 2024-04-16 22.55.55.excalidraw]]
Soft iron is relatively pure iron. Its magnetic domains are usually oriented so that their effects cancel, but the magnetic field produced by the current expands the domains that reinforce the field and shrinks those that oppose it. When the current is switched off, the iron loses almost all its magnetism
An electromagnet is an iron-cored coil designed to produce a strong field beyond the ends of the core (the poles). In the electromagnet below
![[Magnetic Field due to a Current in a Circuit 2024-04-20 18.14.58.excalidraw]]
The field will be roughly uniform in the gap between the poles, though there is some bulging out of field lines near the edges. The flux crossing the gap will be the same as the that passing through a cross-section of the core
