We find that a wire, carrying a [[Electric Current|current]], placed in a [[Magnetic Fields|magnetic field]], at an angle to the field, experiences a force
![[Motor Effect 2024-04-15 17.14.03.excalidraw]]
In the apparatus we are concerned with the force on the horizontal portion, XY, of the current-carrying wire WXYZ. Note the position of XY, at an angle to the magnetic field direction
With a current of a few amperes in the XY direction, XY experiences an appreciable downward force. The magnet assembly producing the field experiences an upward force of equal magnitude. This shows up on the electronic balance supporting the assembly
We find that the force is proportional to the length, $l$, of the wire (XY), the current, $I$ and the sine of the angle between the current and the field. This force must also increase with the strength of the field, or the [[Magnetic Flux Density]]. Combining these, we get:
$$
F=BIl\sin\theta
$$
In which $F$ is the magnitude of the force. $B\sin \theta$ is the [[Components of vectors|component of the vector]] perpendicular to the wire, sometimes written as $B_{\bot}$
## Current Carrying Coil
We examine the forces on a rectangular current-carrying coil (of $N$ turns) orientated with the normal to its plane at an angle $\phi$ to a [[Uniform Magnetic Fields|uniform magnetic field]]
![[Motor Effect 2024-04-15 18.00.44.excalidraw]]
We first note that, according to [[Fleming's Left Hand Motor Rule]], the force on side WX is upwards and the force on YZ is downwards. These forces are not only equal and opposite, but also in the same vertical plane - that of the coil. Their only effect is to stretch the coil unnoticeably
![[Motor Effect 2024-04-15 18.13.21.excalidraw]]
The forces (of magnitude $F_{b}$) on XY and ZW are also equal and opposite, but this time they are 'staggered' apart by a distance of $\frac{a}{2}\sin \phi$, making up what is called a 'couple'. Adding the moments of these forces about the axis of rotation, we get the total torque to be:
$$
\tau=2F_{b} \times \frac{a}{2}\sin \phi=2NBIb\sin90^{\circ}\times \frac{a}{2}\sin\phi
$$
$$
\implies \tau=NBIA\sin \phi
$$
Here we have $ab=A$, since $ab$ is the area of the coil. There is more to this substitution than mathematical shorthand: it turns out that the last equation applies for a flat coil of any state, $A$ being the coil area. Note that the effect of having $N$ turns on the coil is to make the effective current $N$ times larger
