A magnetic field line (or line of magnetic flux) is a line whose direction at every point is the direction of the magnetic field at that point

By moving a plotting compass so that its South pole is successively where its [[North Pole (of a Magnet)|North pole]] was previously, we can trace or 'plot' a [[Magnetic Fields|magnetic field]] line. If we start in different places, we can plot (in theory) as many lines as we like in a region

The figure above shows what emerges when we investigate the region around a bar magnet in this way. The compass magnet's North pole points in the direction of the resultant magnetic field, in this case the resultant of the magnet's field and the Earth's field. As long as we stay near the magnet, its field is much stronger than the Earth's, so the pattern of field lines is almost entirely due to the magnet
Note the following properties of the lines:
1. Magnetic field lines never cross or meet. If they could, it would be unclear which way a magnet would point at their intersection. In fact, it points in the direction of the resultant field, which is everywhere well-defined
2. Magnetic field lines are closed (end-less) loops. Although we can't show this with a plotting compass, the lines that arrive at the South pole of a magnet continue (from S to N) through the magnet, emerging at the North pole
3. When field lines become closer together, the field is becoming stronger - as near the poles of a magnet
Compare the lines with streamlines in a smoothly flowing liquid... the direction of a streamline shows the direction of liquid velocity at a point, and where streamlines become greater. Indeed, magnetic field lines are sometimes called lines of magnetic flux, the primary meaning of the word flux being 'flow'. We don't however believe anything is actually flowing along a magnetic field
