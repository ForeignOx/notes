The weak force affects all particles and has a very small range of $\sim 10^{-18}\pu{ m}$ and is only significant when [[Electromagnetic Force|e-m]] and [[Strong Force|strong]] interactions are not involved. It always involves a [[Neutrinos|neutrino]]. It is the second weakest out of strong, e-m, weak and [[Gravitational Force|gravitational]]. Furthermore, it is carried by vector bosons ($\ce{ W+ }$, $\ce{ W- }$ and $\ce{ Z^0 }$)
The weak force is responsible for the decay of neutrons in neutron-rich nuclei, giving rise to $\ce{ \beta- }$ decay
