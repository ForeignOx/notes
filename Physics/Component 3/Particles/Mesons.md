[[Hadrons]] composed of a [[Quarks|quark]] and an antiquark, e.g. [[Pions|pions]]
Mesons are created in copious numbers when [[Baryons]] are collided at moderate to high energies. A typical meson-generating reaction is
$$
\ce{ p +p -> p + n + \pi+ }
$$
which at the quark level can be written:
$$
\ce{ uud +uud -> uud +udd +u\bar{\text{d}} }
$$
