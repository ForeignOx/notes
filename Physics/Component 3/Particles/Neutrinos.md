[[Leptons|Neutrinos]] are neutral particles of very low mass which only interact via the weak force. This means that they need to come within $\sim 10^{-18}\pu{ m}$ to interact, so interactions hardly ever happen: for example, a typical solar neutrino could expect to penetrate a [[Light-Year]]'s thickness of lead
The first evidence for their existence came from studies in the 1930s of the energy spectrum of [[Beta Decay|beta]] particles. Phosphorus-32 decays by $\ce{ \beta- }$ emission. Before neutrinos were known, the complete reaction was expected to be:
$$
\ce{ ^32_{15}P -> ^32_{16}S +e- }
$$
The energy release in the decay is $1.71\pu{ MeV}$. If we apply the [[Law of Conservation of Momentum]], we can calculate that the beta particles should take nearly all the energy, with the much heavier sulphur nucleus taking a tiny fraction. Compare this with the actual energy spectrum

We can see that $1.71\pu{ MeV}$ is in fact the maximum beta particle energy, but there is a continuous spectrum of energies with the peak being $0.7\pu{ MeV}$. This energy is spectrum is only possible if a third particle is also produced, which can share the energy with the beta particle. This particle is called the neutrino (strictly the electron antineutrino) and the complete reaction is:
$$
\ce{ ^32_{15}P -> ^32_{16}S +e- + \bar{\nu_{e}} }
$$
