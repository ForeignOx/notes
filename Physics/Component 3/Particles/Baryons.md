w[[Hadrons|Hadrons]] composed of 3 [[quarks]], e.g. proton, neutron
The quark structures of protons and neutrons can be written as:
$$
\ce{ p=uud }
$$
$$
\ce{ n=udd }
$$
Protons are the only stable baryon
There are only 6 first generation baryons, the two nucleons above and the $\Delta$ family:
$$
\ce{ \Delta++ = uuu }
$$
$$
\ce{ \Delta+ = uud }
$$
$$
\ce{ \Delta^0 = udd }
$$
$$
\ce{ \Delta- = ddd }
$$
Note that the quark structures of $\ce{ \Delta+ }$ and $\ce{ \Delta^0 }$ are the same as those of $\text{p}$ and $\text{n}$ respectively, but the masses are different. The $\ce{ \Delta+ }$ can be regarded as an excited state of the proton: similarly, for $\Delta^0$ and the neutron
