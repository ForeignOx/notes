An [[Emf]] is induced in a [[Electrical Conductors|conductor]] when it moves in such a way that it cuts (moves across) lines of [[Magnetic Flux]]. An example of this is pulling the horizontal wire XY sharply upwards and observe that the voltmeter gives a reading while the wire is moving

Note these points:
- There is no reading if we move the wire from left to right, it is not cutting lines of flux, but slipping between them
- If the moving conductor is part of a complete circuit, the emf will give rise to a [[Electric Current|current]]. An emf in the X to Y direction in the wire urges a current from X to Y in the wire, and therefore from Y to X in the rest of the circuit. From the voltmeter’s point of view, Y acts like the positive terminal of a battery. If the rest of the circuit is not complete, there will still be a [[Potential Difference]] between X and Y equal in magnitude to the emf
- If we consider the movement of electrons in the wire as a current through the air, using [[Fleming's Left Hand Motor Rule]], there will be a force on the electrons parallel to the wire, so the electrons will travel in the wire from Y to X, inducing a current from X to Y
- Strengthening the [[Magnetic Fields|magnetic field]], lengthening the wire within the field, and moving the wire faster all increase the emf
Consider a metal rod of length $l$ moving at a constant velocity $v$, cutting a [[Uniform Magnetic Fields|uniform magnetic field]] of flux density $B$.
![[Emf Induced in a Moving Conductor 2024-04-22 17.51.25.excalidraw]]
Each free electron in the rod is carried along with the rod and so has the rod's velocity, $v$. It therefore experiences a magnetic force $Bev$ from what we know about [[Magnetic Fields on Moving Charges]]. Free electrons in the rod are, then, urged to drift in the direction YX, making a conventional current in direction XY. The emf, $\mathscr{E}$, that is the [[Energy]] per unit [[Electric Charge|charge]] given to electrons passing through the rod, that is from Y to X. Therefore:
$$
\mathscr{E}=\frac{\text{work done on electron}}{e}=\frac{\text{force on electron}\times \text{distance moved in force direction}}{e}
$$
$$
\implies \mathscr{E}=\frac{Bev\times l}{e}
$$
$$
\implies \mathscr{E}=Blv
$$
This equation applies to the rather limited case of a straight wire, when wire, field and wire's velocity are all at right angles to each other
