The direction of an [[Emf Induced in a Moving Conductor|induced emf]] is such that its effects oppose the change producing it
## Lenz's Law Applied to the Rod on Rails
![[Lenz's Law 2024-04-22 21.01.19.excalidraw]]
What counts, in this case, as the change producing the [[emf]]? Is it the rod moving to the right? Or is it the consequent increase in [[Flux Linkage|flux linked]] with the circuit? Either will do...
The effects of the emf are the that there will be a [[motor effect]] force on the rod XY. Lenz's law demands that this must be to the left to oppose the rod's motion. Using [[Fleming's left hand motor rule]], we see that the [[Electric Current|current]] in the rod is in the direction XY, so the emf must be in the direction XY. The current in the loop will set up its own magnetic field. Across the area WXYZ, this must be out of the page. According to the [[right hand grip rule]], to produce flux out of the page, the loop current has to be in the sense WXYZW, so the emf in the rod is in the direction XY. This yields the same conclusion as before
## Lenz's Law and [[Principle of Conservation of Energy|Energy Conservation]]
Why should the effects of the emf oppose the change producing it? Suppose the emf in the rod XY were in the other direction: then, once the rod were given an initial push to the right, the motor effect force, now to the right, would take over the rodâ€™s propulsion, while at the same time we'd be getting free heat from the resistor. This violates the principle of conservation of energy
## Shrinking Band Cutting Flux
Suppose a round balloon with a band of metallic paint around its equator deflates by a radius $\delta r$ in a time $\delta t$. Assuming a [[Uniform Magnetic Fields|uniform field]] of [[Magnetic Flux Density|strength]] $B$ is at right angles to the balloon's equatorial plane, as the area enclosed by the band decreases, so does the flux linked with it. $N=1$ and the flux density is always normal to the area, so $\phi=0$
![[Faraday's Law 2024-04-22 18.54.33.excalidraw]]
The emf in the band must be in the clockwise sense so that the current is in this sense and (according to the right-hand grip rule) produces flux directed into the page through the area bounded by the band. This opposes the decrease, due to the shrinking of the bounded area, in the original flux
## Mutual Induction
This occurs when a changing [[Electric Current|current]] in one circuit causes an emf to be produced in another circuit, because some or all of the (changing) magnetic flux produced by the first is linked with the second
![[Faraday's Law 2024-04-22 20.43.25.excalidraw]]
We can deduce that a decrease in the 'clockwise' current in the solenoid will induce an emf in the $N$-turn coil
## Bar Magnet into Coil
Here are 'snapshots' of a magnet moving at constant speed through a coil
![[Lenz's Law 2024-04-23 16.57.31.excalidraw]]
In the first snapshot, the sense of the emf and current in the coil is such that flux produced by the coil goes from right to left through the coil, opposing the increase in left to right flux from the magnet. And the coil's left. In the last snapshot, the opposite is observed, so the current goes in the other direction. At the centre, there is no emf, so also no current
By studying the magnet's field lines in relation to the coil, observe how the graph below shows the time variation of the flux linkage ($N\Phi$)

The gradient of this graph gives us minus the induced emf, in accordance with [[Faraday's Law]]:
