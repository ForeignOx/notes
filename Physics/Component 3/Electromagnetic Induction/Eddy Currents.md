Eddy currents are [[Electric Current|currents]] take closed loops in conducting material in bulk. They arise from [[Emf Induced in a Moving Conductor|electromagnetic induction]]
Consider a magnet moving towards a suspended aluminium ring. An [[emf]] in induced in the ring, as in the coil.  The ring is effectively a single turn coil with its ends connected together ('short-circuited'), so the emf drives a current round it. The ring is repelled by the magnet in accordance with [[Lenz's Law]]

Consider instead a plate instead of a ring. This is also repelled. We can think of the plate as containing a ring like that in the previous example, and many others. The constraint of an actual ring or loop is not needed for the current to take such a path. Currents that follow closed loops in conducting material in bulk are called eddy currents
Another example of the effect of eddy currents uses the apparatus below:
![[Eddy Currents 2024-04-23 18.20.20.excalidraw]]
We displace the sector through an angle from its lowest position, and release it. As it swings through the magnetic field, its motion is very noticeably [[Electromagnetic Damping|damped]]. Eddy currents in the metal experience [[motor effect]] forces that oppose the motion. A convincing control experiment is to substitute a sector with radial slots. The electromagnetic damping is greatly reduced, as there can no longer be large eddy current loops
## Energy Dissipation through Eddy Currents
Eddy currents head conductive material, just as a current heats a wire. The atoms of the material gain extra random [[energy]] of vibration - and the temperature rises. We say that energy is dissipated
Induction hobs use eddy currents in the bottoms of suitable saucepans to heat them and hence, by thermal conduction, and usually convection, the contents of the saucepan. The eddy currents arise from emfs generated by rapidly alternating and therefore changing currents in coils underneath the pans
Eddy currents are often unwanted. For example, if the cores of coils were lumps of solid iron, they would heat up if the coils were carried alternating currents. Changing [[magnetic flux]] in the core would be linked with closed paths in the core. Energy dissipation in the iron cores of transformers and of AC motors is greatly reduced by laminating the cores, that is making them out of thin sheets of iron, insulated from each other, so preventing large eddy current loops
