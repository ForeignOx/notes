When the [[Electric Current|current]] in a coil changes by $\delta I$ the [[Flux Linkage]] of that same coil or circuit changes by $\delta N\Phi$, given by:
$$
\frac{dN\Phi}{dI}=L
$$
$L$ is called the [[Self-Induction|self-inductance]] of the coil or circuit. It is constant if there is no iron core. It has unit of $\pu{ \Omega s=H}$
The [[Emf]] induced in a coil or circuit due to changing current in that coil or circuit is given by:
$$
\mathscr{E}=-L\frac{d I}{dt} 
$$
This is derived from [[Faraday's Law]]
