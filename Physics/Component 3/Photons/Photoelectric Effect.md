If [[electromagnetic radiation]] is shone onto a negatively charged metal plate, the plate loses charge, this is the photoelectric effect
The vacuum photocell provides a simple way of investigating the photoelectric effect. It consists of a cylindrical cathode (K) made from a photo-emissive metal and an anode (A) placed in front of it. The whole is surrounded by an evacuated glass envelope. Incoming e-m radiation hits the surface of the cathode, liberating electrons. The [[Electric Current|current]] is proportional to light intensity, enabling it to be used as a light meter. Note that, in the discussion of the photoelectric effect, the word 'light' should be taken to include near infrared and ultraviolet infrared radiation

If we measure the $I-V$ characteristics of a photocell we notice that:
- For positive [[Potential Difference|potential differences]] above a minimum level the current is constant - all emitted electrons are collected by the anode
- This 'plateau current' is proportional to the light intensity
- There is a positive current for small negative values of $V$ down to a 'stopping voltage' $V_{S}$ (the same value for all light intensities)

If we assume that the [[photoelectrons]] are emitted with a range of [[Kinetic Energy|kinetic energies]], the value of $V_{S}$ enables us to measure the maximum value of this, $E_{k\text{ max}}$. If an electron with $E_{k\text{ max}}$, is just stopped by $V_{S}$, then from the definition of potential difference:
$$
E_{k \text{ max}}=eV_{S}
$$
The experiments which showed that the radiation did not behave as waves concerned the variation of $E_{k\text{ max}}$ with the [[frequency]], $f$, of the radiation. A suitable circuit is shown below:
![[Photoelectric Effect 2024-04-10 13.00.31.excalidraw]]
Notice the polarity of the voltage supply. The photocell is illuminated with monochromatic radiation. The potential difference applied across the photocell is adjusted using the potentiometer until the current just becomes zero and the value, $V_{S}$ is measured. This is repeated for a range of frequencies, $f$, and for different metal surfaces. The results of such experiments are as follows:
1. If electrons are emitted, there is no measurable time delay
2. For any metal there is a characteristic threshold frequency, $f_{th}$, below which no electrons are emitted, whatever the intensity of the radiation
3. There is a linear relationship between $E_{k \text{ max}}$ and the frequency, with the same gradient for all metals ($h$)
4. If electrons are emitted, $E_{k\text{ max}}$ is independent of the radiation intensity
5. If electrons are emitted, the number of electrons emitted per second is proportional to the intensity of the radiation
![[Photoelectric Effect 2024-04-10 13.36.11.excalidraw]]
The results are incompatible with the idea that the [[energy]] of radiation is absorbed continuously, as it would be if light behaved as a [[Progressive Waves|wave]]. There should be no threshold frequency. Low frequency, low intensity radiation could transfer energy gradually to electrons which would eventually build up enough energy to escape from the metal surface, after a time delay. High intensity radiation would be expected to transfer energy more quickly than low intensity and some electrons should gain more energy making $E_{k \text{ max}}$ higher
Einstein proposed the following model to explain the experimental results:
1. Electromagnetic radiation consists of discrete packets of energy, photons, with the photon energy given by $E=hf$, where $h$ is Planck's constant
2. When a photon interacts with an electron in the metal surface, its entire energy is transferred
3. An electron only interacts with an individual photon - the probability of two photons interacting with an individual electron is vanishingly small
4. There is a characteristic minimum energy called the [[work function]], $\phi$, which is needed to remove an electron from a metal surface
Taken together, these postulates explain all the results of the experiment. The maximum energy of the photoelectrons is given by:
$$
E_{k \text{ max}}=hf-\phi
$$
This is known as Einstein's photoelectric equation, which is a consequence of the postulates above
