Light-emitting diodes are electronic devices constructed from a small crystal of a semiconductor material, such as gallium arsenide, $\ce{ GaAs }$. It conducts electricity in one direction and, as it does so, it gives out [[electromagnetic radiation]].  Many LEDs are designed to give out close to monochromatic radiation, but some emit a broad spectrum
Pure $\ce{ GaAs }$ has the very high [[resistivity]] of about $10^{6}\pu{ \Omega}$ at room temperature, which is $\sim10^{13}$ times as high as most metals. However, the addition of very small quantities of specific impurity atoms, in a process called doping, can reduce the resistivity by many orders of magnitude. In particular:
- Doping with $\ce{ Si }$ or $\ce{ Ge }$ (group IV metals, with 4 electrons in the outer shell) results in mobile electrons in the $\ce{ GeAs }$ lattice, the resulting crystal is called an n-type semiconductor
- Doping with $\ce{ Be }$ or $\ce{ Mg }$ (group II metals, with only two outer electrons) results in mobile regions called holes with a net positive charge - a p-type semiconductor
A single crystal is grown with p-type doping at one end and n-type at the other. A small fraction of the mobile electrons and holes diffuse to the centre and combine producing the depletion zone, a region without mobile charge carriers. But if a sufficiently high [[potential difference]] is established across the LED with the p-type positive and the n-type negative, the charge carriers are pushed together and the whole crystal becomes conducting; mobile electrons 'fall into' the holes giving out photons of light
