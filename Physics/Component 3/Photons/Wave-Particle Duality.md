[[Electromagnetic Radiation|Light]] exhibits the [[Progressive Waves|wave]] properties of [[diffraction]] and [[interference]]. When its [[speed]] is measured in materials, it corresponds to the wave model explanation of [[refraction]]. On the other hand, the [[Emission Spectra|emission]] and [[Absorption Spectra|absorption]] of light demands a particle model. The particle properties of [[Atomic Energy Levels|energy]] and [[Photon Momentum|momentum]] are calculated using the wave-property values of [[frequency]] and [[wavelength]]. So our picture is that light has both wave and particle properties. This is referred to as wave-particle duality
Just as electromagnetic radiation can behave as both waves and particles, objects that we normally think of particles, such as electrons, protons and even whole atoms have wave-like properties. In other works, particles exhibit diffraction and interference. The [[Young's Double Slit Experiment|double slit experiment]] is harder to arrange for electrons, and involves firing a stream of electrons through a narrow slit to hit a fluorescent screen so that each impact causes a bright spot. To find wave-like property of particles of wavelength, you can use the [[de Broglie wavelength]]
