The reason why atomic gases have [[line spectra]] is to do with the way in which atoms can possess energy. Just as light comes in discrete amounts, atomic systems can only possess particular levels of energy. The simplest atom is the $\ce{ ^1_{1}H }$ atom because it consists of just two particles. Its energy levels are shown below:

Virtually all the energy shown consists of the sum of the [[Kinetic Energy|kinetic]] and potential energies of the electron in motion around the nucleus. An atom is excited if is in an energy state above the ground state. Conventionally, a stationary free electron outside the atom is shown as having zero energy; an electron trapped inside the atom must be given energy to escape so its total energy must be negative. The lowest energy level, called the ground state, has $-13.6\pu{ eV }$of energy, so must be given $13.6\pu{ eV }$in order to escape from a hydrogen atom, this is called the [[Enthalpy Change of nth Ionisation|ionisation energy]] of hydrogen. They symbol $n$ is used for the principal quantum number of the energy state and corresponds to the [[Electron Orbital|electron shells]]. At low temperatures, the electron in a hydrogen atom is most likely to be found in the lowest shell, but could, in principle, be in any of the shells
