[[De Broglie Wavelength|De Broglie's equation]] also applies to [[Photoelectric Effect|photons]]. This means that if photons are absorbed or reflected by an object, their [[momentum]] changes and so, by the [[law of conservation of momentum]], the object suffers an equal and opposite momentum change. It is often more convenient to express the momentum of a photon in terms of the [[frequency]], $f$, rather than the [[wavelength]] of the [[Electromagnetic Radiation|radiation]]:
$$
p=\frac{h}{\lambda}=\frac{hf}{c}
$$
But $hf$ is the photon energy, so the photon momentum is:
$$
p=\frac{E_\text{ph}}{c}
$$
One of the consequences of photon momentum is that a beam of radiation exerts a pressure on any surface which it hits. The beam of photons incident on the surface of area $A$, has [[Intensity of Radiation|intensity]] $I$. Thus the total energy delivered in a time $\delta t$ is given by $IA\delta t$, therefore the momentum of the incident photons in a time $\delta t$ is:
$$
p=\frac{IA\delta t}{c}=\int \frac{IA}{c} \, dt 
$$
If the surface is totally [[Black Body|black]], so that all the momentum is absorbed, the rate of change of momentum of the photons is:
$$
\frac{d p}{dt} =-\frac{IA\delta t}{c\delta t}=-\frac{IA}{c}
$$
In other words, by [[Newton's Second Law of Motion]], the radiation exerts a force of:
$$
F=\frac{IA}{c}
$$
On the surface, so the pressure is:
$$
P=\frac{I}{c}
$$
