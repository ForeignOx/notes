Consider an atomic system that exists in two [[Atomic Energy Levels|energy states]], U and L (upper and lower) of a system with energies $E_\text{U}$ and $E_\text{L}$. An atom or molecule can change its state from U to L by spontaneously [[Emission Spectra|emitting]] a [[Photoelectric Effect|photon]] of [[frequency]] $f$ such that:
$$
hf=E_\text{U}-E_\text{L}
$$
This process is often referred to as spontaneous emission and is illustrated below:
