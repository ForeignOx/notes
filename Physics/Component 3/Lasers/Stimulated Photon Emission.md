Consider an atomic system that exists in two [[Atomic Energy Levels|energy states]], U and L (upper and lower) of a system with energies $E_\text{U}$ and $E_\text{L}$. This atom can undergo stimulated [[Photoelectric Effect|photon]] emission, not to be confused with [[Spontaneous Photon Emission]]. The way this process occurs an atom in the upper energy state (U) is stimulated into moving down into the lower energy state by another photon of the same energy: $hf=E_\text{U}-E_\text{L}$. In doing so, it emits a second photon which is in [[Phase of Oscillation|phase]] with the first one and travelling in the same direction
