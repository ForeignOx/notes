When two [[Elastic Materials|elastic objects]] collide, their separation [[velocity]] is less than their collision velocity. To a good approximation, the ratio of their separation speed to the collision speed is a constant called the coefficient of restitution, $e$.
![[Coefficient of Restitution 2024-04-23 21.10.53.excalidraw]]
The coefficient of restitution is defined by:
$$
e=\frac{\text{relative velocity after collision}}{\text{relative velocity before collision}}=\frac{v_{1}+v_{2}}{u_{1}+u_{2}}
$$
If the directions of the velocities are different to the diagram, adjust them by changing their signs accordingly. Note that $0\leq e\leq 1$
We can relate this to the relative bounce height of a ball

From an initial height, $H$, the speed of impact can be calculated using [[uniform acceleration equations]] to be $\sqrt{ 2gH }$. If it bounces to height $h$, the speed just after impact is equal to $\sqrt{ 2gh }$. Because the floor isn't moving, we can write:
$$
e=\frac{\sqrt{ 2gh }}{\sqrt{ 2gH }}=\sqrt{ \frac{h}{H} }
$$
