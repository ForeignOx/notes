The moment of inertia, $I$, of an object consisting of $n$ particles is defined by:
$$
I=\sum_{i=1}^nm_{i}r_{i}^{2}
$$
where $m_{i}$ and $r_{i}$ are the mass and distance from the axis of rotation of the $i$th particle. The moment of inertia is the rotational equivalent of [[mass]]
Working out the moment of inertia of an extended solid object can be tricky, unless it has an easy symmetrical shape. An exception is a thin uniform cylindrical ring:

This is easy because all the particles are at the same distance $r$, from the axis of rotation, $C$. Hence, $I=mr^{2}$. Here are some standard formulae for moments of inertia:

| Object          | $I$                  |
| --------------- | -------------------- |
| Uniform ring    | $mr^{2}$             |
| Uniform disc    | $\frac{1}{2}mr^{2}$  |
| Solid sphere    | $\frac{2}{5}mr^{2}$  |
| Spherical shell | $\frac{2}{3}mr^{2}$  |
| Uniform rod     | $\frac{1}{12}mr^{2}$ |
