In order to change the [[Angular Momentum]] of a body, we need a couple, which is two equal and opposite forces with different lines of action:
![[Angular Momentum 2024-04-23 22.14.34.excalidraw]]
The turning effect of a couple is its [[Moments|moment]] or torque, $\tau$. The moment of the couple about any point on the diagram is given by:
$$
\tau=Fd
$$
But can't we produce a rotation without having two forces, just by having a single force applied off-centre? Consider a ball affected by an off-centre force $F$, which can be considered to be a force through the centre of mass (which produces linear [[Acceleration]]) and a couple, which produces [[Angular Acceleration]]
![[Torque 2024-04-23 22.24.28.excalidraw]]
The angular acceleration, $\alpha$, is calculated from $\tau=I\alpha$, which is the rotational equivalent of [[Newton's Second Law of Motion]], $F=ma$
