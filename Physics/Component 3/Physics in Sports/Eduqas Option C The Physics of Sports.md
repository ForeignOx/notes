## Overview
This topic studies the use of the centre of gravity in explaining how stability and toppling is achieved in various sporting contexts. The concept of moment of inertia is introduced together with the principle of conservation of angular momentum and their application to different sporting contexts is studied. Projectile motion and the Bernouilli equation and their application to sporting events is also studied.

## Learners should be able to demonstrate and apply their knowledge and understanding of:
- how to use the [[Centres of Gravity|centre of gravity]] to explain how stability and toppling is achieved in various sporting contexts
- how to use the [[principle of moments]] to determine forces within
    - various muscle systems in the human body and
    - other sporting contexts, for example, sailing
- how to use Newton’s 2nd law in the form [[impulse|$Ft=mv-mu$]] in various sporting contexts
- the [[coefficient of restitution]] as $e=\frac{\text{Relative speed after collision}}{ \text{Relative speed before collision}}$ and also use it in the form $e=\sqrt{ \frac{h}{H} }$ where $h$ is the bounce height and $H$ is the drop height
- what is meant by the [[moment of inertia]] of a body
- how to use equations to determine the moment of inertia, $I$, for example
    - a solid sphere $I=\frac{2}{5}mr^{2}$
    - a thin spherical shell $I=\frac{2}{3}mr^{2}$ where $m$ is the mass and $r$ is the radius
- the idea that [[angular acceleration]], $\alpha$, is defined as the rate of change of angular velocity, $\omega$, and how to use the equation $\alpha=\frac{\omega_{2}-\omega_{1}}{t}$
- the idea that [[torque]], $\tau$, is given as $\tau=I\alpha$
- [[angular momentum]], $L$, is given as $L=I\omega$ where $\omega$ is the angular velocity
- the principle of [[conservation of angular momentum]] and use it to solve problems in sporting contexts
- how to use the equation for the [[rotational kinetic energy]], rotational $KE=\frac{1}{2}I\omega^{2}$
- how to use the principle of conservation of energy including the use of linear and rotational kinetic energy as well as gravitational and elastic potential energy in various sporting contexts
- how to use projectile motion theory in sporting contexts
- how to use [[lift|Bernoulli’s equation]] $P=p_{0}-\frac{1}{2}\rho v^{2}$ in sporting contexts
- how to determine the magnitude of the [[drag]] force using $F_{D}=\frac{1}{2}\rho v^{2}AC_{D}$ where $C_{D}$ is the drag coefficient
