Another similarity between linear and rotational motion is the conservation of [[Angular Momentum]]. In the absence of externally applied [[Torque|torques]], the angular momentum of a body system of particles is constant. This principle has universal application from orbiting planets ([[Kepler's Second Law of Planetary Motion]] is a consequence of this)
