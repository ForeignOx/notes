Whether in tennis, football or golf, it is well known that a spinning ball will swerve away from the forward spinning side, as illustrated below
![[Magnus Effect 2024-04-24 20.12.40.excalidraw]]
Top spin will make a ball dip down; bottom spin will hold the ball up against gravity and spin about a vertical axis will make it veer to one side. There are two main explanations that rely on the experimental observation that the air which follows over the top of the ball separates later than the air which follows underneath. This has the effect of bending the air flow downwards
## Bernoulli Explanation
Because of the direction change, the air which flows over the left of the ball travels faster than the air on the right. So, by [[lift|Bernoulli]], the pressure on the left is lower than the pressure on the right. The pressure difference causes a force to the left
## Newton's Explanation
The air is given a rightward momentum as it is deflected so the ball acquires an equal and opposite momentum
