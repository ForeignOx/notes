The drag force can be given by the Stokes' formula:
$$
F_{D}=\frac{1}{2}\rho v^{2}C_{D}A
$$
For low values of $v$, the [[Velocity]] of the object. $\rho$ is the [[Density]] of the fluid the object is passing through, $A$ is the surface area of the object in the direction of the object's motion and $C_{D}$ is a dimensionless quantity called the drag coefficient, which depends upon the shape of the object.
## Aerodynamic Drag
The air flow around the aerofoil below is turbulent

The airflow around the aerofoil below is lamina

There are two main [[Drag]] components:
- the [[Friction]] drag is due to the interaction of the moving air with the boundary layer which is a thin layer of stationary air in contact with the object
- The pressure drag is due to the difference in pressure between the front of the object and the back
Both of these two components vary as $v^{2}$, the head-on area, $A$, of the object and the [[Density]], $\rho$ of the air, so the total drag force can be expressed using the Stokes' formula above. The constant $C_{D}$ is called the drag coefficient, but unfortunately it isn't really constant

The variation of $F_{D}$ with $v$ for a football in the graph above shows that the [[Air resistance]] is roughly proportional to $v^{2}$ up to $20\pu{ m s-1}$, where the air flow is lamina. Then the flow becomes turbulent and the air resistance plummets with speed before to take off again. The lower speed region is dominated by the friction drag — at higher speeds the pressure drag dominates. This distinction controls the way that footballers curve the ball into the net
One may wonder how to reduce the air resistance and assume that it involves making an object smoother, but this is in fact wrong. For example in the early twentieth century, golfers found they could hit their old scuffed golf balls further than their nice new smooth ones. The reason for this is all to do with the boundary layer. The dimples trap a turbulent layer of air next to the golf ball, which the air slides past smoothly and round the ball. This lamina flow separates much later from the ball leaving a smaller turbulent wake than the smooth golf ball. It is the pressure difference between the front and back which produces the drag. Because the low wake pressure acts over a smaller area in the dimpled ball, the drag is lower
