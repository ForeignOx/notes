What is the [[kinetic energy]] of the rotating system of connected spheres in the diagram below?
![[Rotational Kinetic Energy 2024-04-23 21.55.59.excalidraw]]
Taking the mass of the bar to be negligible:
$$
E_\text{k}=\frac{1}{2}m_{1}v_{1}^{2}+\frac{1}{2}m_{2}v_{2}^{2}
$$
We can express this in terms of the [[angular speed]], $\omega$, using the relationship, $v=r\omega$
$$
E_\text{k}=\frac{1}{2}m_{1}(r_{1}\omega)^{2}+\frac{1}{2}m_{2}(r_{2}\omega^{2})
$$
This can be rewritten as:
$$
E_\text{k}=\frac{1}{2}(m_{1}r_{1}^{2}+m_{2}r_{2}^{2})\omega^{2}
$$
This is in the same form as the equation $E_\text{k}=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$ for linear motion, with $\omega$ replacing $v$ and the quantity $m_{1}r_{1}^{2}+m_{2}r_{2}^{2}$ replacing $m$. This is called the [[moment of inertia]] and has the symbol $I$. If there are more than two particles then we just add more terms to the sum, and the rotational kinetic energy is given by:
$$
E_\text{k rot}=\frac{1}{2}I\omega^{2}
$$
## Rolling Objects
If an object is spinning and moving along, its total kinetic energy is the sum of the translational and rotational kinetic energies:
$$
E_\text{k}=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}+\frac{1}{2}I\omega^{2}
$$
Where $v$ is the [[speed]] of the [[Centres of Gravity|centre of gravity]] and $\omega$ the angular speed. For a rolling circular object the speed and angular speed are related by $v=r\omega$. This must be the case because the [[velocity]] of the rim is zero at the point of contact with the ground
