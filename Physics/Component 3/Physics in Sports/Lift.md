## Aerodynamic Lift
### Explanation 1
The aerofoil below experiences an upwards force called lift

The spoilers on the backs of sports cars are there to create a downwards force to hold the back of the car to the road, which is also confusingly called lift. Until recently, the accepted explanation was the Bernoulli Effect. If a stationary gas at a pressure $p_{0}$ [[Acceleration|accelerates]] to a [[velocity]] $v$, the pressure falls to $p$ given by:
$$
p=p_{0}-\frac{1}{2}\rho v^{2}
$$
This equation is an expression of the [[principle of conservation of energy]] applied to moving gases. If we imagine multiplying the equation by the volume of a section of gas, the resulting $pV$ is the internal energy and the $\frac{1}{2}\rho v^{2}$ term is the [[kinetic energy]]. In any case, we can interpret the equation as saying that if the velocity of a gas increases, its pressure decreases. Applying this to the aerofoil, the argument runs: the air flowing over the upper curved surface of the wing has a longer path than that under the wing, so its speed is greater and its pressure lower. This difference in pressure produces the lift
### Explanation 2
The second explanation uses [[Newton's Second Law of Motion|Newton's second]] and [[Newton's Third Law of Motion|third]] laws. Consider the aerofoil below

The initial velocity of the air is horizontal to the right; it leaves the wing downwards to the right. The wing pushes the air downwards, so it has exerted a downwards force on the air (Newton's second law); the air exerts an equal and opposite force on the wing (Newton's third law) i.e. an upwards force
