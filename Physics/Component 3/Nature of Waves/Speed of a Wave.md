Suppose we lat a whole [[Period]], $T$ pass as a [[Progressive Waves|wave]] propagates. Each particle will oscillate through one extra [[Cycle of an Oscillation|cycle]], bringing it back to where it started. So the wave has travelled a whole [[Wavelength]], $\lambda$. From this we can define the [[Speed]] of a wave:
$$
v=\frac{\lambda}{T}=f\lambda
$$
