The period, $T$ of an oscillation is the time for one [[Cycle of an Oscillation|cycle]] of oscillation. It has unit of $\pu{ s }$
The period, $T$ in circular motion, is the time taken to complete a complete a revolution, it is related to [[Frequency |frequency]] in the following relationship:
$$
T=\frac{1}{f}
$$
