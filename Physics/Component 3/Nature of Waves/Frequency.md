The frequency, $f$, of an oscillation is the number of [[Cycle of an Oscillation|cycles]] per unit time. It has unit of $\pu{ Hz=s-1 }$
Note that all particles of the medium oscillate with the frequency of the wave source; cycles of oscillation cannot be gained or lost as a wave travels
Frequency, $f$ in the context of circular motion is the number of revolutions per unit of time, it is related to [[Period|period]] in the relationship:
$$
f=\frac{1}{T}
$$
