The phase of oscillation is a measure of how far through the wave's cycle a given point on the wave is, usually measured in radians
The phase difference of two oscillations of the same [[frequency]] is the difference in phase between two points of a wave
Oscillations are in phase if they are at the same point in their [[Cycle of an Oscillation|cycles]] at the same time. They are in antiphase if their phase difference is $\pi$ radians
