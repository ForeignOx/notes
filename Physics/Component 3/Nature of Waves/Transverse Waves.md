In a transverse [[Progressive Waves|wave]], the particles of the mediums are displaces at right actions to the direction of wave travel
___
Transverse waves cannot propagate through gases and liquids because of their inability to withstand [[Types of Stress|shear forces]], hence the inability of S-waves to propagate through the Earth's outer core
___
Electromagnetic waves and secondary (shear) S waves are examples of transverse waves
