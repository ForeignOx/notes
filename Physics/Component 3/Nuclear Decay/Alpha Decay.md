Alpha ($\alpha$) decay is [[nuclear decay]] by the emission of an alpha particle which is composed of two protons and two neutrons; a helium nucleus $\ce{ ^{4}_{2}He }$. Alpha radiation is the most weakly penetrating type of [[nuclear radiation]] (out of $\alpha$, [[Beta Decay|$\beta$]] and [[Gamma Decay|$\gamma$]]). A general alpha decay looks like:
$$
\ce{ ^A_{Z}X -> ^{A-4}_{Z-2}Y +^{4}_{2}He } 
$$
Alpha decay only occurs in heavy elements. The lightest known $\alpha$-decay is Telliurium-106 ($\ce{ ^{106}_{52}Te }$) which decays to an isotope of tin
