## Using Penetrating Power
You can use [[Range of Nuclear Radiation|penetrating power]] to distinguish between [[Alpha Decay|$\alpha$]], [[Beta Decay|$\beta$]] and [[Gamma Decay|$\gamma$]] [[Nuclear Radiation|radiation]]. The rule of thumb is:
- If it can't penetrate a sheet of paper or more than $\sim 3-5\pu{ cm}$ of air, it is $\alpha$
- If it can penetrate above but is stopped by thin metal, it is $\beta$
- If it gets through all of the above, it is $\gamma$
## Deflection of Radiation in [[Magnetic Fields]]
Beams of charged particles constitute [[Electric Current|electric currents]] and so are deflected in magnetic fields. The force is always at right angles to both the magnetic field and the velocity of the particles. Thus, if the particles are travelling at right angles to the magnetic field, their path is [[Centripetal Force|circular]], with the deflection in a direction given by Fleming's left hand rule. The radius, $r$, of the circular path is given by:
$$
r=\frac{p}{qB}
$$
Where $p$ is the [[Momentum]] of the particles, $q$ their charge and $B$ the flux density of the magnetic field
