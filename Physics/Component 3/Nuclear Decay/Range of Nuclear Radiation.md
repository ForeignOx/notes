The range of [[nuclear radiation]] is the distance it will travel before being absorbed. It depends upon the nature and [[energy]] of the radiation and the nature of the medium through which it is travelling. The penetrating power of all forms depends upon their energy: the greater the energy, the greater the range. The denser the medium, the better it is at absorbing radiation of any type, the lower the range
## Absorption of Charged Particles
When a high-energy charged particle penetrates a material, it is able to pass through the constituent atoms, though neither the particle nor the atoms come through unscathed

If an [[Alpha Decay|alpha]] particle with a typical energy of several $\pu{ MeV}$ passes through an atom, it will attract electrons. It doesn't need to collide directly with an electron - the [[Electrical Potential Energy|electric attraction]] will cause an energy transfer and pull several electrons from the atom. The energy transfer is typically a few tens of $\pu{ eV}$. The effect on the $\alpha$ particle is to slow it down slightly, so it passes through the next atom a bit more slowly, increasing the ionising effect. Eventually it runs out of energy, picks up a couple of stray electrons and becomes a helium atom
The effect is the same with [[Beta Decay|beta]] particles - it doesn't matter if they are $\ce{ \beta+ }$ or $\ce{ \beta- }$, they will still kick out electrons. The one difference is that while $\alpha$ and $\beta$ particles have a similar energy range, but electrons and positrons are much less massive, so they travel more quickly (very close to the speed of light)
## Absorption of [[Gamma Decay|Gamma]] Rays
These are ionising too, but their interaction with the electrons of atoms is different in two ways: they are uncharged, so they can only affect an atomic electron if they pass very close, therefore they pass through numerous atoms before interacting, and they lose all their energy in one interaction due to the [[photoelectric effect]]
Suppose we have a parallel beam of gamma rays passing through a uniform radiation, the [[Intensity of Radiation|intensity]], $I$, is given by:
$$
I=I_{0}e^{ -\mu x }
$$
Where $\mu$ is the fraction penetrating per unit distance and $x$ is the distance travelled
## Importance of [[Density]]
Most of the mass of a material is in the nuclei, so the denser the material, the more protons and neutrons there are. The numbers of protons and electrons are the same. Comparing a gas to a solid, there are a lot fewer electrons, and it is these which absorb the radiation. Comparing solids of different elements, atoms are all more or less the same size. As we increase the atomic number, the more the inner electron shells are pulled towards the nucleus, but the radius is hardly changed. This means that the concentration of electrons increases with density
