Electron capture, also known as K capture, is a type of [[Nuclear Decay]] and occurs in some proton-rich nuclei. An electron in the 1s orbital, the lowest [[Atomic Energy Levels|atomic energy level]], spends a tiny fraction of its time actually inside the nucleus. The shading in the image below represents qualitatively the probability density function of the 1s orbital - this is the probability of finding the electron in any particular small region

It is actually a maximum at the centre of the atom, but because the nucleus is so tiny compared to the orbital, the electron actually spends a tiny fraction of its time there. Nevertheless, when it does, the following reaction can occur:
$$
\ce{ p + e- -> n +\nu_{e} }
$$
