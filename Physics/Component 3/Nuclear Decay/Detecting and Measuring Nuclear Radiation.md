[[Nuclear radiation]] is generally detected by the ionisation that it produces. Because it is only weakly ionising, [[Gamma Decay|$\gamma$]] is therefore more difficult to detect than [[Alpha Decay|$\alpha$]] and [[Beta Decay|$\beta$]]. A detector for $\alpha$ radiation must also be constructed with a very thin window, otherwise the radiation will not be able to ever the detector

The Geiger-Müller tube is a common detector for all three types of radiation

The nuclear radiation ionises the gaseous atoms. The liberated electrons are attracted to the positively charged metal needle and pick up enough [[kinetic energy]] to cause further ionisation on the way. The resulting pulse of current produces a [[Potential Difference|voltage]] pulse across the resistor which is registered on the counter
## Solid State Detectors
Solid state detectors are diodes with the n-type region connected to the positive. The n region is very thin so that $\alpha$ radiation can penetrate it into the depletion zone, $d$. Here it ionises the silicon, creating large numbers of electrons and holes, which are drawn to the $+V$ and earth respecgtively and constitute a pulse of current. This produces a potential difference pulse across the resistor which is registered by a counter

The advantages of solid state detectors are that they operate on low voltages and their dead time is very small, so they can detect high levels of radiation. Their performance does degrade with time however as they accumulate radiation damage
