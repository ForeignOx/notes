Beta ($\beta$) decay is [[nuclear decay]] by the emission of an electron or a positron
The more common form is $\ce{ \beta- }$ decay, which takes place in neutron-rich nuclei. A neutron decays, via the weak interaction, into a proton with the emission of an electron and an electron anti-neutrino:
$$
\ce{ n->p +e- +\bar{\nu_{e}} }
$$
The general $\ce{ \beta- }$ decay looks like:
$$
\ce{ ^A_{Z}X-> ^A_{Z+1}Y + \beta- +\bar{\nu_{e}}}
$$
Some nuclei, created in fusion processes, can decay by the emission of a positron, rather than an electron. In the context of radioactivity, this is called a $\ce{ \beta+ }$ decay. In order for this to happen, a proton must transform into a neutron (with the emission of a positron and a neutrino):
$$
\ce{ p -> n + e+ +\nu_{e} }
$$
The general $\ce{ \beta+ }$ decay looks like:
$$
\ce{ ^A_{Z}X -> ^A_{Z-1}Y + \beta+ +\nu_{e} }
$$
$\ce{ \beta+ }$ decay seems unlikely considering conservation of mass/energy; the proton has a mass of $938.3\pu{ MeV}/c^{2}$, the neutron is more massive: $\ce{ 939.6\pu{ MeV}/c^{2} }$. And then there is the positron with a mass of $0.5\pu{ MeV}/c^{2}$, to say nothing of the [[kinetic energy]] of the neutrino. The reason this is possible is because, just like electrons in atoms, the neutrons and protons in a nucleus each have their own sets of [[Atomic Energy Levels|energy levels]]:

The proton in the top energy level can transform and drop down into the vacant neutron energy level if $\Delta E$ is enough
