Nuclear decay, or radioactive decay, is the process by which the nucleus of an atom loses [[energy]] by emitting [[nuclear radiation]]. The atomic nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons, themselves composite particles consisting of combinations of up and down quarks. In the same way that atoms have [[Atomic Energy Levels|energy levels]], so do nuclei. A nucleus with excess energy can drop to lower energy levels in various ways
Nuclear decay is inherently random, so it is very hard to measure over a small timescale, but as long as the [[Activity of Radioactive Sources|activity of the radioactive sample]] is constant over the timescale of the experiment, it doesn't matter whether one long reading is taken or repeat readings adding up to the same time. In all cases, the mean rate will be the total count divided by the total time
The decay is entirely unaffected by temperature, pressure or any other physical condition. We cannot predict when an individual nucleus will decay, but we can determine the probability so within any time period, this is the [[decay constant]]
In general, the relationship between the number of particles $N$, the activity $A$ and the decay constant is:
$$
A=\lambda N
$$
We can normally write the initial values of $N$ and $A$ as $N_{0}$ and $A_{0}$. We know that after $x$ [[Half-Life|half-lives]], these values will have been reduced by a factor of $2^{x}$ so we can write:
$$
N=\frac{N_{0}}{2^{x}}
$$
$$
A=\frac{A_{0}}{2^{x}}
$$
It is important to note that $x$ can take any value, not just positive whole numbers. We can also use the following formulae in terms of time rather than the number of half-lives:
$$
N=N_{0}e^{ -\lambda t }
$$
$$
A=A_{0}e^{ -\lambda t }
$$
