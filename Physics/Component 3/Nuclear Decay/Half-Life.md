The half-life is the time taken for the number of nuclei of a [[Nuclear Radiation|radioactive]] [[nuclide]] (or [[Activity of Radioactive Sources|activity]]) to halve
The unpredictable, random [[Nuclear Decay|decay]] of radioactive sources leads to the half-life law. The rate of decay of a single radioactive nuclide is proportional to the number of atoms, so if the number remaining halves, the rate of decay halves. Hence, the time taken for the remaining to fall to any given fraction is constant
We can derive a relationship between the [[decay constant]] and the half-life using activity:
$$
A=A_{0}e^{ -\lambda t }
$$
By definition, after time $t=T_{\frac{1}{2}}$, $A=\frac{1}{2}A_{0}$
$$
\implies e^{ -\lambda T_{\frac{1}{2}} }=\frac{A}{A_{0}}=\frac{1}{2}
$$
$$
\implies -\lambda T_{\frac{1}{2}}=-\ln 2
$$
$$
\implies \lambda =\frac{\ln 2}{T_{\frac{1}{2}}}
$$
