The emf (electromotive force) of a [[Electrochemical Cells|cell]] or [[Batteries|battery]] is the [[Energy]] that changes category from chemical to electrical potential per unit [[Electric Charge|charge]] passing through the cell, it has unit: $\pu{ JC-1=V }$
When the cell is an [[Open Circuit]], the charges that have been transferred to the electrodes prevent the further transfer of charge. The condition for no further transfer of charge is that the [[Potential Difference]], $V$, is equal to the emf $E$. Hence, for a an open circuit, $E=V$
