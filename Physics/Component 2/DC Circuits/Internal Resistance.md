If we connect a load (such as a resistor) between the [[Electrochemical Cells|cell]] terminals, we provide an external conductive path, so [[Electric Charge|charge]] can flow continuously in a complete closed loop, and [[Energy]] transfers occur. However we find that the [[Potential Difference]] across the ell terminals drops when we connect a load across the terminals so that there is a [[Electric Current|current]]. The lower the resistance of the load, the greater the current, $I$ and the lower the potential difference $V$. $E$ is the [[Emf]] and a reasonable approximation is:
$$
V=E-Ir
$$
In which $r$ is a constant with the unit $\pu{ \Omega }$, called the internal resistance of the cell. $r$ can be shown in cell diagrams like below:
![[Internal Resistance 2024-03-21 20.37.28.excalidraw]]
$r$ raises from collisions of [[ions]] drifting through the electrolyte, it can't be measured directly since it is inseparable from the charge-transferring role of the cell demonstrated by the emf
The internal resistance of a [[Batteries|battery]] is the sum of the internal resistances of the cells
