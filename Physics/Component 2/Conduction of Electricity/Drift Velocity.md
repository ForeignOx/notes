Free electrons share in the random thermal energy of the metal. A typical thermal speed for an electron at room temperature is $10^{5}\pu{ ms-1 }$. Because the directions of motion are random, changing when the free electrons hit the vibrating ions, the thermal motion doesn't produce a [[Electric Current|flow of charge]] along the wire. We're only concerned with any superimposed drift velocity of free electrons in one direction along the wire, such what occurs when a battery is connected across the ends of wire
