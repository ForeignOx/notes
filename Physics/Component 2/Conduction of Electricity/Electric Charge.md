Electric charge or charge is a fundamental property of subatomic particles that gives rise to the phenomenon of experiencing force in [[Electric Fields|electric]] and [[Magnetic Fields]]
Protons have a positive charge, and electrons have a negative charge. Charge is a [[Scalar Quantities|scalar quantity]], usually denoted by $Q$ or $q$, the SI unit of charge is the coulomb $\pu{ C}$. A proton's charge is denoted by $e$. An electron's charge is denoted by $-e$. $e=1.602\times 10^{-19}\pu{ C }$
