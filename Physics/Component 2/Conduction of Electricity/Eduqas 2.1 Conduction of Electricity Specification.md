## Overview
This topic covers the basic ideas of electric charge and electric current. The nature of charge carriers in conductors is explored.
## Mathematical Skills
There are a number of opportunities for the development of mathematical skills in this unit. These include recognising and using expressions in decimal and standard form; using ratios, fractions and percentages; making order of magnitude calculations; calculating areas of circles, surface areas and volumes of rectangular blocks and cylinders.
## How Science Works
There are opportunities within this topic for learners to use theories, models and ideas to develop scientific explanations.
## Learners should be able to demonstrate and apply their knowledge and understanding of:
- the fact that the unit of [[Electric Charge|charge]] is the coulomb (C), and an electron's charge, e, is a very small fraction of a coulomb
- the fact that charge can flow through certain materials, called [[Electrical Conductors|conductors]]
- [[Electric Current]] being the rate of flow of charge
- the use of the [[Electric Current|equation]] $I=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}$
- [[Electric Current|current]] being measured in amp√®res (A), where $\pu{ A=Cs-1 }$
- the mechanism of conduction in metals as the [[Drift Velocity|drift of free electrons]]
- the derivation and use of the [[Electric Current|equation]] $I=nAve$ for free electrons
