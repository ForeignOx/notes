The [[Electric Fields|electric field]] strength, $E$, at a point, $P$, is defined as:
$$
E=\frac{\text{force of a charge}, q, \text{at }P}{q}=\frac{F}{q}
$$
It is a [[Vector Quantities|vector]] whose direction is that of the force on a positive test charge. It has unit of $\pu{NC-1=Vm-1  }$
Note that if we double the test [[Electric Charge|charge]], the force will double, so we get the same value for $E$. If we change from a positive test charge to a negative one, the force direction will reverse, but dividing $F$ by a negative quantity ($q$) reverses the direction again. In other words, $E$ tells us about the field in which we place $q$, independently of the magnitude or sign of $q$
In the [[Coulomb's Law]] equation we can regard one of the charges as the source of an electric field, and the other as a testing charge. Calling these $Q$ and $q$ respectively, the equation becomes:
$$
F=\frac{Qq}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r^{2}}
$$
Dividing by $q$ gives:
$$
E=\frac{F}{q}=\frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r^{2}}
$$
where $r$ is the distance from $Q$
Outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution, such as a conducting sphere with charge spread evenly on its surface, the field strength is the same as if all the charge were concentrated in the centre. In fact, if a spherical conductor is given charge, free charge carriers will move in such a way that the charge will spread evenly over the surface by mutual repulsion. However, any nearby external charges will disturb the symmetry. For example, in Coulomb's experiment, it's not, in the first instance, the spheres that repel, but the charges on them, and being effectively mobile, these will move so that the far sides of the spheres have more charge than the facing sides. So the spheres don't quite behave as point charges at their centres
## More than one charge
In principle we can calculate the electric field strength due to any spatial distribution of charges by viewing the charge distribution as a collection of point charges, calculating $E$ at $P$ due to each point charge and adding them as vectors
