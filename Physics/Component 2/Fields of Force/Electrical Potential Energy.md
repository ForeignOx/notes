The [[electrical potential]] [[energy]] of a test [[Electric Charge|charge]], $q$, at a point $P$ in an [[Electric Fields|electric field]], is the [[work]] done by the field on $q$ as $q$ goes from $P$ to 'infinity'. So the potential energy for a test charge $q$ is:
$$
PE=qV=\frac{qQ}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r}
$$
## Derivation
Recall that work is force multiplied by distance in direction of force. The force on $q$ is $qE$, radially outwards from $Q$. But $E$ decreases as we go from $P$ to infinity, this is because:
$$
E=\frac{Q}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}r^{2}}
$$
 We can therefore calculate the work done in small steps at a time, with distance $\delta r$, and we can see that the work done on $q$ as $q$ moves a distance $\delta r$ from $Q$ is equal to:
 $$
W=\int_{r_{P}}^{\infty} qE \, dr =\frac{qQ}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\int _{r_{P}}^{\infty} \frac{1}{r^{2}} \, dr 
$$
$$
=\frac{qQ}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\left[ -\frac{1}{r} \right]_{r_{P}}^{\infty}=\frac{qQ}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\left( 0-\left( -\frac{1}{r_{P}} \right) \right)
$$
The limits in the above integration have been ignored
$$
=\frac{qQ}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r_{P}}
$$
Which can be generalised to
$$
EPE=\frac{qQ}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r}
$$
