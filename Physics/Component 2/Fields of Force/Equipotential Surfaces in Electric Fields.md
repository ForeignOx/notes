An equipotential surface in an [[Electric Fields|electric field]] is an imaginary surface on which all points are at the same [[Electrical Potential|potential]]
Note that the surfaces are closer together where the field is stronger, this is due to:
$$
E=-\frac{dV}{dx}
$$
The [[electric field lines]] are at right angles to equipotential surfaces as they pass through them
