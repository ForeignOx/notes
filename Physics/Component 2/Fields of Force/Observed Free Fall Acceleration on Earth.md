On the Earth, at all latitudes except $\pm 90^{\circ}$ (the poles), the observed acceleration of free fall, $g_\text{obs}$, is a little less that the gravitational acceleration, $g$. This is because $g$ includes the [[centripetal acceleration]], $r\omega^{2}$, needed to keep the body rotating about the Earth's axis (at a distance $r$ from the axis). In our rotating frame of reference, we don't observe $r\omega^{2}$. At the equator, $r\omega^{2}$, like $g$, is directed towards the centre of the earth, $g_\text{obs}$ must therefore also be in this direction and:
$$
g=g_\text{obs}+r\omega^{2}
$$
$$
\implies g_\text{obs}=g-r\omega^{2}
$$
At the poles $r\omega^{2}=0$ and $g_\text{obs}=9.832\pu{ ms-2 }$. At the equator, $r\omega^{2}=0.034\pu{ ms-2 }$. but $g_\text{obs}=9.780\pu{ ms-2 }$. Clearly the different vale of $r\omega^{2}$ does not account for all the $0.052\pu{ ms-2 }$ discrepancy in $g_\text{obs}$. The rest is due to the Earth not being a perfect sphere. At the equator, $g$ itself is very slightly less than at the poles - which are very slightly closer to the centre of the Earth. For simplicity, we ignore $r\omega^{2}$ as $r\omega^{2}\ll g$
