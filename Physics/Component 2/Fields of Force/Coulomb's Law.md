The force between point [[Electric Charge|charges]], $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$, in a vacuum and separated by a distance $r$ is given by:
$$
F=\frac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r^{2}}
$$
In which $\epsilon_{0}$ is the permittivity of free space. By experiment, $\epsilon_{0}=8.85\times 10^{-12}\pu{ Fm-1 }$. It is useful to note that $\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}=9.0\times 10^{9}\pu{ F-1 m}$ to 2 significant figures
## Derivation
In the early 1780s, Charles-Augustin de Coulomb measured the forces between small, charged, [[Electrical Conductors|conducting]] spheres. He used a torsion balance in which the [[moments|moment]] of the repulsive force on one of the spheres was balanced by the moment due to the twisting of a fibre
![[Coulomb's Law 2024-03-26 17.13.15.excalidraw]]
He found that when the separation between centres and force were related by $F \propto \frac{1}{r^{2}}$ for point charges. We now know that this relationship gives the following:
$$
F=\frac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r^{2}}
$$
Note that if $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ are both positive or both negative, $F$ is positive, so we can interpret a positive $F$ as a repulsive force, if $F$ is negative, then the force is attractive instead. This equation holds almost exactly if the charges are separated by air at ordinary densities. Only when the separating medium is a solid or liquid insulator is the force substantially reduced
