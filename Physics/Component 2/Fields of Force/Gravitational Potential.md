The gravitational potential, $V$, at a point $P$ in a gravitational field is the [[work]] done by the field per unit mass on a test mass if it goes from $P$ to infinity. It has units $\pu{ Jkg-1 }$
So, for a test mass $m$, 
$$
V=\frac{E_{p}}{m}
$$
Where $E_{p}$ is the [[gravitational potential energy]]. And hence, at a distance $r$ from the centre of $M$, 
$$
V=-\frac{GM}{r}
$$
## More than one body
When the field at a point $P$ arises from more than one body, the potential, $V$, is the scalar sum of the potentials that would arise from each body
