The gravitational field strength, $g$ at a point is defined as:
$$
g=\frac{F}{m}
$$
That is
$$
g=\frac{\text{force on a test mass, } m}{m}
$$
It is a [[Vector Quantities|vector]] with units $\pu{ Nkg-1 }$
At a distance $r$ from the centre of a spherically symmetric mass distribution, $M$, 
$$
g=(-)\frac{GM}{r^{2}}
$$
Outside the sphere containing $M$
If the only force acting on a body is gravitational, then, using [[Newton's Second Law of Motion]], it's acceleration is:
$$
a_{grav}=\frac{F}{m}=\frac{mg}{m}=g
$$
Measuring a body's gravitational acceleration in a location amounts to measuring the gravitational field strength there
A body's gravitational acceleration is independent of its mass; all bodies have the same gravitational acceleration in the same place
## Derivation
If the mass of a sphere exerting a gravitational field is $M$, and $m$ is a test mass outside the sphere we can put $m_{1}=M$ and $m_{2}=m$ into [[Newton's Law of Gravitation]], to give
$$
F=\frac{GMm}{r^{2}}
$$
$$
\implies \frac{F}{m}=\frac{GM}{r^{2}}
$$
so
$$
g=\frac{GM}{r^{2}}
$$
Where $r$ is the distance from the test mass to the centre of the sphere
The above result suggests that $g$ acts away from $M$, so a negative sign is often shown to signify $g$ being directed inwards along a radius:
$$
g=-\frac{GM}{r^{2}}
$$
## More than one body
When the field at a point $P$ arises from more than one body, the field strength, $g$, is the vector sum of the field strengths at $P$ that would arise from each body by itself
