An object in a raised position can do [[Work]] on other objects as it descends. Thus it possesses energy because of its height. We call this gravitational potential [[Energy]] with symbol $E_{p}$ or $U$. Technically the energy is possessed by not just the body, but also the object causing the body to feel gravitational attraction. Imagine doing work on an object of [[Mass]] $m$ by raising it a distance of $\Delta h$ at a constant speed (so no change in [[Kinetic Energy]])
$$
E_{p}=F\Delta h=mg\Delta h
$$
## GPE in terms of gravitational fields
The potential energy of a test mass, $m$, at a point $P$ in a gravitational field is the work done by the field on $m$ as $m$ goes from $P$ to infinity
Hence the work done by the field on $m$ is negative because the gravitational force on $m$ will be back towards the body or bodies responsible for the field, that is essentially the opposite direction to $m$'s journey from $P$ to infinity. This makes the  gravitational potential energy, $E_{p}$, a negative quantity, approaching zero as $P$ approaches infinity. The zero of $E_{p}$ at infinity is contrived for mathematical convenience
We now concentrate on the potential energy of $m$ at a point $P$ outside a spherically symmetric mass distribution, $M$. We know that the $E_{p}$ is $m$ multiplied by the area under the $g-r$ graph, which is given by the equation for [[gravitational field strength]], so:
$$
E_{p}=m\int _{r_{P}}^{\infty}g \, dr = -GmM\int_{r_{P}}^{\infty} \frac{1}{r^{2}} \, dr  
$$
$$
=-GmM\left[ -\frac{1}{r} \right]_{r_{P}}^{\infty}=-GmM\left( 0-\left( -\frac{1}{r_{P}} \right) \right)
$$
Ignoring the limits in the integral
$$
E_{p}=-\frac{GmM}{r_{P}}
$$
Which can be generalised to:
$$
E_{p}=-\frac{GmM}{r}
$$
