Every body with mass attracts every other body with mass. For two 'point masses', $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$, separated by distance $r$, the force is given by:
$$
F=\frac{Gm_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}
$$
In which $G$ is a constant known as Newton's constant of gravitation
Newton showed that a consequence of the inverse square law would be that a spherical shell of evenly distributed mass would exert the same force on an external body as if all its mass were concentrated at its centre. No force would be exerted by the shell on any body placed inside it
Newton's law of gravitation is also valid for spherically symmetric objects
