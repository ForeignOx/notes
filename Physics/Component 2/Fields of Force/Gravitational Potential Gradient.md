A test mass, $m$ moving a distance $\delta x$ in the direction of a gravitational field will have [[Work]] $mg\delta x$ done on it by the field, so change in [[Gravitational Potential Energy]], $\delta E_{p}$ is:
$$
\delta E_{p}=-mg\delta x
$$
and change in [[Gravitational Potential]], $\delta V$ is:
$$
\delta V=-\frac{mg\delta x}{m}=-g\delta x
$$
So:
$$
g=-\frac{dV}{dx}
$$
