Consider a particle that is experiencing forces in a [[uniform electric field]]. We'll consider that all other forces on the particle are negligible. This generally requires the particle to be in a vacuum, so there are no collision forces on it
The force, $qE$, on a [[Electric Charge|charged]] particle is the same in magnitude and direction wherever the particle is in a uniform [[Electric Fields|electric field]]. This implies that:
- Its [[Components of vectors|component]] of [[velocity]] at right angles to the field doesn't change
- Its component of velocity in the direction of the field changes at a constant [[acceleration]] given by:
$$
a=\frac{F}{m}=\frac{qE}{m}
$$
So the particle's path is either straight or parabolic, and the exact path can be calculated mathematically using the [[uniform acceleration equations]]
## Change of Speed in relation to [[Potential Difference]]
Suppose a particle of mass $m$ and charge $q$ moves from $A$ to $B$ in an electric field (not necessarily uniform), we know that the [[kinetic energy]] gained by the particle is equal to the [[electrical potential energy]] lost by the particle, so:
$$
\frac{1}{2}m(v_{B}^{2}-v_{A}^{2})=-q\Delta V
$$
In which $\Delta V$ is the potential difference in going from $A$ to $B$. Note that the value of $q$ is signed
