Resistivity determines the [[Resistance|resistance]] of a given material
Suppose there is a [[Electric Current|current]] $I$ in a wire of length $l$ when a [[Potential Difference|pd]] $V$ is placed across it. [[Energy]] is changing category uniformly along its length, so the pd across half of it must be $\frac{V}{2}$, so the resistance of a wire length $\frac{l}{2}$ is equal to:
$$
\frac{V}{2I}=\frac{1}{2}\times\text{resistance of length }l
$$
Hence resistance is proportional to length of wire:
$$
R\propto l
$$
We can also regard the piece of wire to be made up of two 'length-ways halves' each with half the cross-sectional area like below:
![[Resistivity 2024-03-08 23.19.14.excalidraw]]
Each half will carry half the current, so the resistance of a wire of cross-sectional area $\frac{A}{2}$ is:
$$
\frac{V}{\frac{I}{2}}=2\times \text{resistance of area A}
$$
Hence resistance is inversely proportional to cross-sectional area:
$$
R\propto \frac{1}{A}
$$
We can incorporate these into a single equation which includes the resistivity, which is a constant which determines the resistance for a given metal:
$$
R=\frac{\rho l}{A}
$$
Where $\rho$ is the resistivity with units $\pu{ \Omega m }$
