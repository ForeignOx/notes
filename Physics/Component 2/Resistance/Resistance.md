The resistance $R$ of a [[Electrical Conductors|conductor]] is defined by the [[Potential Difference]] across a conductor divided by the [[Electric Current|current]] through the conductor:
$$
R=\frac{V}{I}
$$
Resistance has the unit ohm ($\pu{ \Omega=VA-1}$)
If [[Electric Charge|charge]] flows in a metal, it is by the [[Drift Velocity|drift]] of free electrons. For drift to occur through a metal wire, each free electron needs a force on it, urging it along the wire. Putting it another way, there must be a [[Potential Difference]] across the wire, as this implies [[Work]] is done on the charges which implies forces acting on them in the direction of motion
A constant force on a free electron will give it a constant acceleration until the free electron  collides with one of the vibrating [[ions]], which means that the electron's acquired drift velocity will be reduced to zero, meaning that, on average, it has to accelerate from rest, giving a particular drift velocity, and from $I=nAve$, a particular current dependant on the pd across the wire, meaning that the wire has a finite resistance, due to collisions between free electrons and vibrating ions. The amplitude of vibration of the ions increases due to the harder hits, meaning the wire gets hotter
## Resistance in Series

If meters were placed to measure the potential difference $V$ and the current $I$ shown above, then $\frac{V}{I}$ would give the combined resistance $R$ of the two resistors. But we also know that potential differences in series add up, so
$$V=V_{1}+V_{2}+\dots+V_{n}$$
The current is the same throughout, so the equation can be written
$$
IR=IR_{1}+IR_{2}+IR_{n}
$$
$$
\implies R=R_{1}+R_{2}+R_{n}
$$
Hence we add resistances in series
## Resistance in Parallel
![[Resistance 2024-03-18 21.39.43.excalidraw]]
The resistors are in parallel, and from [[Kirchhoff's First Law]], the sum of the currents through each resistor is equal to the overall current $I$:
$$
I=I_{1}+I_{2}+\dots+I_{n}
$$
There is only one potential difference, $V$, so
$$
\frac{V}{R}=\frac{V}{R_{1}}+\frac{V}{R_{2}}+\dots+\frac{V}{R_{n}}
$$
$$
\implies \frac{1}{R}=\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\frac{1}{R_{2}}+\dots+\frac{1}{R_{n}}
$$
This can be rewritten in terms of conductance like so:
$$
G=G_{1}+G_{2}+\dots+G_{n}
$$
Note that the combined resistance is less than any of the individual resistances
