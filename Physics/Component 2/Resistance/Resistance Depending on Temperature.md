A metal wire's [[Resistance|resistance]] increases with temperature. This can be investigated using simple apparatus. This effect is due to the metal's change in [[Resistivity]], since the thermal expansion of the wire makes only fractional changes to $l$ and $A$
The reason the resistance increases with temperature is because for a given [[Potential Difference|pd]] applied across a wire, the mean [[Drift Velocity]] will is limited by the collisions with the vibrating [[ions]]. The higher the temperature, the greater the vibration amplitude and the shorter the mean time between collisions, reducing the drift velocity $v$, and since $I=nAve$, this also decreases the [[Electric Current|current]], so because $R=\frac{V}{I}$, this increases the resistance
Note that for a metal, the free electron concentration, $n$ does not depend on temperature
Applying a large enough pd causes Joule heating, so when we double the pd, the current goes up, but less than double
