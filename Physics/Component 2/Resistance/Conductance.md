The conductance $G$ or a [[Electrical Conductors|conductor]] is defined by the [[Electric Current|current]] through the conductor divided by the [[Potential Difference]] across the conductor, and is the reciprocal of the [[Resistance|resistance]]:
$$
G=\frac{I}{V}=\frac{1}{R}
$$
Conductance has unit of siemens ($\pu{ S=AV-1}$)
