## Overview
This topic covers the relationship between current and potential difference and develops the ideas of resistance and resistivity. The heating effect of an electric current is explored and the variation of resistance with temperature of metals is
investigated.
## Working Scientifically
The specified practical work in this topic gives learners the opportunity to apply investigative approaches and methods to practical work; to safely and correctly use a range of practical equipment and materials; to keep appropriate records of experimental activities; to correctly construct circuits from circuit diagrams using D.C. power supplies, cells and a range of circuit components.
## Mathematical Skills
There are a number of opportunities for the development of mathematical skills in this unit. These include recognising and using expressions in decimal and standard form; estimating results; using calculators to find and use power functions; using an appropriate number of significant figures; finding arithmetic means; making order of magnitude calculations; changing the subject of an equation, including non-linear equations; translating information between graphical, numerical and algebraic forms; drawing and using the slope of a tangent to a curve as a measure of rate of change.
## How Science Works
There are opportunities within this topic for learners to use theories, models and ideas to develop scientific explanations; to use appropriate methodology, including ICT to answer scientific questions and solve scientific problems; to know that scientific knowledge and understanding develops over time. Learners can carry out experimental and investigative activities, such as the comparison of the I-V characteristics of metal wires, filament lamps, LED lamps and diodes and use spreadsheets to analyse and evaluate their data. They can then make informed
decisions on the use of energy saving devices in their homes.
## Learners should be able to demonstrate and apply their knowledge and understanding of:
- the definition of [[Potential Difference]]
- the idea that [[Potential Difference]] is measured in volts (V) where $\pu{ V=JC-1 }$
- the characteristics of I – V graphs for the filament of a lamp, and a metal wire at constant temperature
- [[Ohm's Law]], the equation $V=IR$ and the definition of resistance
- [[Resistance]] being measured in ohms (Ω), where $\pu{ \Omega=VA-1 }$
- the application of $P=IV=I^{2}R=\frac{V^{2}}{R}$
- collisions between free electrons and ions gives rise to electrical [[Resistance]], and electrical [[Resistance Depending on Temperature|resistance increases with temperature]]
- the application of$R=\frac{\rho l}{A}$ the equation for [[Resistivity]]
- the idea that the resistance of metals varies almost linearly with temperature over a wide range
- the idea that ordinarily, collisions between free electrons and ions in metals increase the random vibration energy of the ions, so the temperature of the metal increases
- what is meant by [[Superconductivity]], and superconducting transition temperature
- the fact that most metals show superconductivity, and have transition temperatures a few degrees above absolute zero (–273 °C)
- certain materials (high temperature superconductors) having transition temperatures above the boiling point of nitrogen (–196 °C)
- some uses of superconductors for example, MRI scanners and particle accelerators
