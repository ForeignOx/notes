One way of demonstrating that a charged [[capacitor]] store [[energy]] is to discharge it through a conducting device and measure the amount of energy is spent. Electrons flow off the negative plate through the conducting device, and to the positive plate. As the [[Electric Charge|charge]] $Q$ on the plates decreases, the [[potential difference]], $V$, between them falls. This is simply a consequence of $V=\frac{Q}{C}$. 
Both charge and potential difference decrease exponentially, so if you plot them against each other for a [[Discharging a Capacitor|capacitor discharge]], you will get a straight line:

So the energy, $U$,  which is the area under the graph, will be simply:
$$
U=\frac{1}{2}QV=\frac{1}{2}CV^{2}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{Q^{2}}{V}
$$
Where $Q$ and $V$ are the initial charge and potential difference
