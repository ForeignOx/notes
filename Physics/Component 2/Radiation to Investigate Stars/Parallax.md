Parallax can be used to measure very large distances, such as distances to stars:

Over the period of half a [[year]], the nearby star appears to shift when seen against the background of much more distant stars because the Earth moves around in its orbit. If we know $r$, the radius of the orbit and we can measure the angle, $\theta$, we can calculate the distance $d$ to the star. Using trigonometry, $\tan\theta=\frac{r}{d}$, so $d=\frac{r}{\tan\theta}$. As $\theta$ is very small, we can use the approximation $\tan\theta=\theta$ to get:
$$
d=\frac{r}{\theta}
