The variation in [[intensity of radiation]] with [[wavelength]] due to absorption by a material is called the absorption spectrum
___
In a cloud of atomic hydrogen in space, most of the atoms will be in the [[Atomic Energy Levels|ground state]] but some will be in the first excited state. The cloud will be flooded with [[Photoelectric Effect|photons]] of a large range of energies, which come from nearby stars. The difference in energy, $\Delta E$ between the 2nd and 1st excited states is $1.9\pu{ eV}$. If a $1.9\pu{ eV}$ photon hits an atom, which is in the $n=2$ state, it may be absorbed and giving its energy to the electron and putting it in the higher energy-state. Photons with slightly higher or lower energies will not be absorbed, so [[Electromagnetic Radiation|radiation]] which passes through the cloud will be depleted in photons with this energy, giving rise to one of the dark lines in the absorption spectrum
For atoms or ions which only have one electron, the energy levels can be calculated using the formula:
$$
E_{n}(\pu{ /eV})=-13.6 \frac{Z^{2}}{n^{2}}
$$
Where $Z$ is the atomic number. This formula also approximately gives the energy level of the innermost electron in atoms with more than one electron
