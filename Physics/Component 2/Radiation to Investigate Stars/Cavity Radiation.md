Cavity radiation is an excellent approximation to [[Black Body]] radiation, and it is the radiation coming from a small hole in the side of a furnace. If radiation enters the cavity through the opening, it will undergo multiple reflections. If the material lining the cavity is very dark, it will absorb most of the radiation at each reflection so hardly any of the incident radiation will re-emerge from the aperture. Because the furnace is hot, it also emits radiation, some of which escapes through the hole. The spectra of this radiation at various temperature resemble [[Black Body Spectra]]
