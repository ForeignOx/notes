The intensity, $I$, of radiation is the [[Git?/Physics/Component 1/Energy Concepts/Power]] per unit area incident on a surface at right angles to the radiation. The unit is $\pu{ W m-2 }$
We can relate the intensity of a [[Electromagnetic Radiation|radiation]] beam to the number of photons crossing an area per second. Consider a monochromatic beam, of [[Frequency]] $f$, crossing a surface. Let $N$ be the number of photons crossing the surface per second. The power in the radiation is given by:
$$
P=NE_\text{ph}
$$
Where $E_\text{ph}$ is the energy of an individual photon. Considering the [[Photoelectric Effect]], this can be written as:
$$
P=Nhf=\frac{Nhc}{\lambda}
$$
We can now relate this to the [[Inverse Square Law]] by considering a point (or spherical) source of monochromatic radiation of power $P$. At a distance $r$, this radiation crosses an area of $4\pi r^{2}$. So the intensity, $I$, of the radiation is given by:
$$
I=\frac{Nhf}{4\pi r^{2}}
$$
Most sources of radiation are far from monochromatic, but if the intensity, at all individual frequencies drops off as $r^{-2}$, the inverse square law must apply to all radiation whatever the spectral distribution
