Radiation from a small source, such as a star spreads out as it moves out. The further from the star, the bigger the area the same quantity  of radiation has to cover, so the lower the [[Intensity of Radiation|intensity of the radiation]]
![[Inverse Square Law 2024-03-26 22.29.52.excalidraw]]
Let $L$ be the [[Luminosity of a Star|luminosity of the star]]. As it crosses the first sphere, of radius $r_{1}$, this radiation is spread out over the surface of the sphere, which has an area of $4\pi r_{1}^{2}$, so the intensity is given by:
$$
I=\frac{L}{4\pi r_{1}^{2}}
$$
At $r_{2}$, the intensity is
$$
I=\frac{L}{4\pi r_{2}^{2}}
$$
