Treating the [[Doppler Effect|Doppler shift]] as representing the speed of recession, we can use [[Newton's Law of Gravitation]] to investigate whether the universe will expand forever. We'll consider the matter in a shell of space at a radius, $r$, from our galaxy, $G$. Assuming that the universe is homogeneous:
The mass of the shell is given by:
$$
m_{s}=4\pi r^{2}\rho\Delta r
$$
And the mass within the shell is given by:
$$
M_{s}=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}\$rho
$$
where $\rho$ is the mean density of the universe. By [[Hubble's Law]], the recession speed of the shell is given by:
$$
v_{s}=H_{0}r
$$
The [[kinetic energy]] and [[gravitational potential energy]] of the shell are: 
$$
E_{k}=\frac{1}{2}m_{s}v_{s}^{2}
$$ and
$$
E_{p}=-\frac{GM_{s}m_{s}}{r}
$$
Substituting for $M_{s}$, $m_{s}$ and $v_{s}$ from the above and simplifying gives:
$$
E_\text{Total}=E_{k}+E_{p}=2\pi r^4\rho H_{0}^{2}\Delta r-\frac{16}{3}G\pi^{2}r^4\rho^{2}\Delta r
$$
If $E_\text{Total}>0$, the shell will expand forever, if $E_\text{Total}<0$ then the shell will reach a maximum distance and then collapse. If $E_\text{Total}=0$ it will come to a halt at an infinite distance and the universe has 'flat geometry'.

For a flat universe, then, by setting $E_\text{Total}=0$ and rearranging, we can get the following expression for density:
$$
\rho_{c}=\frac{3H_{0}^{2}}{8\pi G}
$$
Where $\rho_{c}$ is called the critical density
