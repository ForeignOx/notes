## Orbits around Compact Bodies
From [[Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion]] and the [[orbital velocity]] equation we obtain the following:
$$
T^{2}=\frac{4\pi^{2}a^{3}}{GM}
$$
$$
v^{2}=\frac{GM}{r}
$$
$$
\bar{v^{2}}=\frac{GM}{a}
$$
 Hence, measuring the radius (or semi-major axis) of an orbit and either the orbital [[period]] or speed enables us to determine the mass of the central object star or planet. If the diameter of the central body is known, its mean density can also be calculated, which enables planetary scientists to develop models of planetary composition
 For example this figure for the density of Mars is much lower than the mean density of the Earth, which is $5520 \pu{ kg m-3 }$ which suggests that Mars has proportionately much less iron than the Earth does. Also the absence of a significant magnetic field suggests that any iron core is completely solid. This fits in with the fact that small objects cool more rapidly than large ones
## Orbits in the Solar System
We can plot the orbital speeds for objects circling the Sun with a [[Rotation Curves|rotation curve]]. The equation of the curve is:
$$
v=\sqrt{ \frac{GM}{r} }
$$
Where $M$ is the mass of the Sun, $1.99\times 10^{30}\pu{ kg }$ ![[Pasted image 20240401163030.png]]
The rotation curve has this simple form because:
- the Sun contains the great bulk of the mass in the Solar System
- the Solar System objects orbit outside the Sun
- the Sun is almost spherically symmetric
These features of the Solar System mean that we can treat the motion of any orbiting body
## Orbits in Spiral Galaxies
The stars in our galaxy orbit the centre of the galaxy, for example the orbit of the Sun has a radius of $\sim 2.7\times 10^{17}\pu{ km }$, orbital speed $\sim 220 \pu{ km s-1 }$. Measuring the orbital speed of stars and gas clouds within our own galaxy is not easy, but it has been done for a large number of other spiral galaxies using the [[Doppler effect]] and [[21 cm Hydrogen Line|21 cm Hydrogen]]
![[Pasted image 20240401164409.png]]
We can calculate the total mass of material within the Sun's orbit:
$$
M=\frac{rv^{2}}{G}
$$
$$
\text{Mass within Sun's orbit}=\frac{2.7\times 10^{20}\times (220\times 10^{3})^{2}}{6.67\times 10^{-11}}=2.0\times 10^{41}\pu{ kg }
$$
Measurements of the mass of stars and interstellar clouds within the galaxy give a maximum mass within the stars orbit of $1.0\times 10^{41}\pu{ kg}$, meaning that the Sun's orbital speed should be about $160\pu{ km s-1 }$. So the Sun should fly off into intergalactic space, along with most of the other stars outside the central bulge. This appears to be true of all galaxies which have been investigated. It is also true of clusters of galaxies; there is apparently not enough mass to hold galaxy clusters together. The way we can explain this is with [[dark matter]]
