The square of the [[Period |period]] of the orbit of an orbiting body, $T$, is propoportional to to the cube of the semi-major axis, $a$, of its orbit:
$$
T^{2}\propto a^{3}
$$

Simplifying, consider a circular orbit, the [[centripetal force]], $F$, on an object moving at constant [[velocity]] in a circle is directed towards the centre and is given by:
$$
F=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}
$$
The only force on the object is [[Newton's Law of Gravitation|gravitational force]]:
$$
F=\frac{GMm}{r^{2}}=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}
$$
$$
\implies v^{2}=\frac{GM}{r}
$$
The velocity is related to the period $T$ by $v=\frac{2\pi r}{T}$, substituting for $v$ and rearranging gives:
$$
T^{2}=\frac{4\pi^{2}r^{3}}{GM}
$$
A circle is an ellipse with eccentricity zero, i.e. the major axes are equal. Thus we can consider $r$ in the equation to be the semi-major axis, $a$ of the 'elliptical' orbit, hence $T^{2}$ is proportional to $a^{3}$
