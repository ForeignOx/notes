Hubble's Law states that the [[Recession Velocity]], $v$, of deep-space objects is proportional to their proper distance, $D$. This can be expressed as:
$$
v=H_{0}D
$$
Where $H_{0}$ is the Hubble constant
The value of the Hubble constant is not easy to determine. The recession velocity emerges from the red shift, but the distance cannot be directly determined by [[Parallax]]. A common method is to use the apparent brightness of [[Standard Candle|standard candles]]

The dots in the above graph represent nearby galaxies. The scatter about the line of best fit is due to the motion of the galaxies through space. The line of best fit itself represents the expansion of space. The galaxies that seem to make an almost vertical line are those in the Virgo cluster of galaxies
