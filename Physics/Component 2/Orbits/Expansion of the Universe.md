Considering [[Hubble's Law]], for every metre an object is away, its recession speed is $H_{0}$. If the rate of the expansion were constant, then the time, $t_{H}$ since all matter was gathered in the same infinitesimal spot is given by:
$$
t_{H}=\frac{1}{H_{0}}
$$
$t_{H}$ is called the Hubble time
We might expect the expansion of the universe to be slowing down because of the effect of gravity. If this is true, then it was expanding more quickly in the past and therefore the time from the big bang is less than the Hubble time

The blue line represents a universe with a constant rate of expansion. This is a universe without any matter in it, so no gravitational deceleration. The green line shows a '[[Critical Density of the Universe|flat universe]]', with the same observed value of the Hubble constant. Recent measurements suggests the universes expansion has in fact been expanding (red line) due to dark energy which comes about from [[dark matter]]
