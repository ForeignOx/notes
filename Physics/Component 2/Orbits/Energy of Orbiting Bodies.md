The total [[mechanical energy]] of bodies which orbit in closed elliptical orbits is negative. The reason for this is that, by definition, the [[Gravitational Potential Energy|potential energy]] of an object an infinite distance from a gravitating body is zero. Thus bodies with a positive total mechanical energy would be able to escape to infinity
## Circular Orbit
The total mechanical energy, $E$, of a body in a circular orbit is the sum of the [[kinetic energy]] and the gravitational potential energy:
$$
E=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}-\frac{GMm}{r}
$$
Using the equation for [[orbital velocity]]:
$$
v^{2}=\frac{GM}{r}
$$
Substituting this into the equation for energy:
$$
E=\frac{1}{2}m\left( \frac{GM}{r} \right)-\frac{GMm}{r}
$$
$$
=-\frac{1}{2} \frac{GMm}{r}
$$
## Elliptic Orbit
Energy of an object in an elliptical orbit:
$$
E=-\frac{1}{2} \frac{GMm}{a}
$$
