We can see that the observed values are much higher than the expected values especially at larger distances from the centre of the galaxy. Assuming [[Newton's Law of Gravitation]] continues to be valid at these distances, there is a lot of 'missing mass' in the galaxy. It turns out we can calculate that we seem to be missing nearly $90\%$ of the mass of the galaxy
This missing mass only appears to be detectable by its gravitational effect, i.e. doesn't interact by the electromagnetic force, otherwise we would detect radiation from it. Other evidence for its existence includes:
## Evidence from Gravitational Lensing
One successful predictions of Einstein's general theory of relativity was that the path of light should be bent by massive objects. This lensing effect of galaxies and clusters of galaxies sometimes leads to multiple images, for example in the Chandra image of the 'clover leaf quasar'

Light from the quasar, labelled source, is diverted into multiple paths, each of which leads to an image. The degree of light bending reveals that the galaxy has much more mass than in the stars and gas clouds
## Evidence from [[CMBR]]
The CMBR retains the imprint of the density fluctuations in the early universe. Baryonic matter and [[nonbaryonic matter]] have different effects. Detailed investigation of the CMBR images leads to the conclusion that $85\%$ of the matter in the universe is nonbaryonic
## Higgs boson relating to dark matter
It has been suggested that the Higgs boson could be the source of dark matter. The Higgs normally decays into bosons or into fermions, but it has been suggested that it could also decay into a photon plus a dark matter particle
