The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the star at one focus
Note that this can be applied to moons orbiting planets by replacing planet with moon and star with planet
Objects with sufficient [[kinetic energy]] to escape to infinity follow an open hyperbolic orbit
![[Kepler's First Law of Planetary Motion 2024-03-27 19.56.03.excalidraw]]
Scenario 1 is when the sum of the kinetic and [[Gravitational Potential Energy|potential energies]] is negative, i.e. $E_{k}+E_{p}<0$, which gives an elliptic orbit
Scenario 2 is: $E_{k}+E_{p}=0$, which gives a parabolic orbit
Scenario 3 is: $E_{k}+E_{p}>0$, which gives a hyperbolic orbit
