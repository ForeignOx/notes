When two bodies exert gravitational attraction on each other, they rotate about their [[Git?/Physics/Component 1/Basic Physics/Centres of Mass|centre of mass]] (C), which for two bodies is quite easy to calculate:
![[Bodies in Mutual Orbit 2024-04-01 21.45.49.excalidraw]]
$$
r_{1}=\frac{m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}d
$$
$$
r_{2}=\frac{m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}d
$$
When we study the motion of binary systems, we can consider the motion in two parts:
1. For the system as a whole, we consider the whole mass to be concentrated at the centre of mass
2. For the motions within the system, we consider the motions relative to the centre of mass
___
Consider circular orbits; as usual, the results also apply to elliptical orbits. The two objects from above are in mutual orbit, but we only consider motion within the system, so the centre of mass remains stationary

We know that $m_{1}v_{1}=m_{2}v_{2}$ otherwise the centre of mass would move, hence each orbits around the centre of mass with the same [[Period |period]]. To calculate this period, consider the motion of $m_{1}$:
The [[Centripetal Force]] on $m_{1}$ is provided the by the [[Newton's Law of Gravitation|gravitational force]] from the other mass, so:
$$
m_{1}r_{1} \frac{4\pi^{2}}{T^{2}}=\frac{Gm_{1}m_{2}}{d^{2}}
$$
Where we have used $\omega=\frac{2\pi}{T}$. Substituting the above value for $r_{1}$:
$$
\frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}d \frac{4\pi^{2}}{T^{2}}=\frac{Gm_{1}m_{2}}{d^{2}}
$$
Dividing by $m_{1}m_{2}$ and rearranging we get:
$$
T=2\pi \sqrt{ \frac{d^{3}}{G(m_{1}+m_{2})} }
$$
