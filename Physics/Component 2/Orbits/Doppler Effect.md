Consider the stationary source, $S$, of light waves below:
![[Doppler Effect 2024-04-01 17.59.37.excalidraw]]
The light waves have a [[frequency]] of $f_{0}$ and spread out with the [[velocity]] of light, $c$, producing a set of spherical wavefronts centred on $S$. A stationary observer in any position will determine the frequency to be $f_{0}$ and the [[wavelength]] to be $\lambda_{0}$, where $c=\lambda_{0}f_{0}$
Next consider the same source moving away from the observer with a velocity, $v$. In the context of astronomy, this is called the [[radial velocity]].
![[Doppler Effect 2024-04-01 18.25.11.excalidraw]]
The wavefronts are still spherical, but their centres move progressively to the right, to the waves which propagate towards the observer have a longer wavelength and therefore a lower frequency. We can derive the magnitude of the effect as follows:
Consider wavefronts which are one cycle apart. The time, $T$, between the emission of the wavefronts is given by $T=\frac{1}{f_{0}}$. In this time, the source has moved a distance to the right equal to:
$$
\frac{v}{f_{0}}=\frac{v}{c}\lambda_{0}
$$
So the observed wavelength is:
$$
\lambda=\lambda_{0}+\frac{v}{c}\lambda_{0}
$$
So the fractional change in wavelength, $\frac{\Delta\lambda}{\lambda_{0}}$ is:
$$
\frac{\Delta\lambda}{\lambda_{0}}=\frac{\lambda-\lambda_{0}}{\lambda_{0}}=\frac{v}{c}
$$
Similarly the equation fro the fractional frequency change, can be worked out using $\lambda=\frac{c}{f}$:
$$
\implies \frac{c}{f}=\frac{c}{f_{0}}+\frac{v}{c} \frac{c}{f_{0}}=\frac{c}{f_{0}}+\frac{v}{f_{0}}=\frac{c+v}{f_{0}}
$$
$$
\implies f=\frac{cf_{0}}{c+v}=\frac{f_{0}(c+v)-f_{0}v}{c+v}=f_{0}-\frac{f_{0}v}{c+v}
$$
$$
\frac{\Delta f}{f_{0}}=\frac{f-f_{0}}{f_{0}}=-\frac{v}{c+v}
$$
Which for $v\ll c$ gives:
$$
\frac{\Delta f}{f_{0}}=-\frac{v}{c}
$$
Many astronomical objects have line spectra, either emission or absorption, and the wavelengths of the lines have been accurately measured. Measuring the wavelengths of these lines in the spectra will tell us their radial velocities, which, in many cases will enable us to determine a quantity of gravitating material 
## Orbiting bodies
We can use the Doppler effect to find [[Exoplanet|exoplanets]], [[Brown Dwarf|brown dwarves]] or other low mass 'companions' orbiting stars. Assuming the star and unseen companion are in [[Bodies in Mutual Orbit|mutual orbit]]. The [[radial velocity]] of the star changes throughout its orbit; if our line of sight is in the plane of the orbit, the amplitude of the variation or radial velocity is the orbital speed of the star. This can be detected by the Doppler shift in the wavelength of the star's [[Emission Spectra|Fraunhofer lines]]
![[Doppler Effect 2024-04-01 22.18.50.excalidraw]]
In the above scenario, the radial velocity of the star, $S$, is negative, giving a negative $\Delta\lambda$. Half an orbit later, $\Delta\lambda$ is positive, the companion, $C$, is detected only by this oscillating Doppler shit. The [[period]] and amplitude of the wavelength variation are determined, the mass of the planet can be estimated:
Assuming the mass of the star is much greater than that of the companion, then we can use:
$$
T^{2}=\frac{4\pi^{2}r^{3}}{GM}
$$
to find the distance of the companion, then calculate its orbital speed using:
$$
v=\frac{2\pi r}{T}
$$
Then we can find the speed of the star using the Doppler shift. Finally use $M_{s}v_{s}=m_{c}v_{c}$ to estimate the mass of the unseen companion.
If two objects in a binary system have comparable masses, it is helpful to have extra information such as the [[orbital velocity]] of the two objects. The whole system is moving away from us with a [[velocity]] $v$, derived from the Doppler shift.

The two components, $A$ and $B$, have orbital velocities given by $v_{A}=v_{1}-v$ and $v_{B}=v_{2}-v$ (assuming we are in the orbital plane). The masses of the two components can be determined from these and the orbital period, $T$. The radii of the orbits of components $A$ and $B$ can be found using:
$$
v_{A}=\frac{2\pi r_{A}}{T}
$$
$$
v_{B}=\frac{2\pi r_{B}}{T}
$$
Then their total separation, $d$, can be found, then we can use:
$$
T=2\pi \sqrt{ \frac{d^{3}}{G(m_{A}+m_{B})} }
$$
To find the total mass of the system, then the individual masses can be found by comparing orbital speeds
