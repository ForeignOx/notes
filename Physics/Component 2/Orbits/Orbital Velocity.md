For a circular orbit, we can equate [[Newton's Law of Gravitation]] and the [[centripetal force]] of rotation:
$$
F=\frac{GMm}{r^{2}}=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}
$$
$$
\implies v^{2}=\frac{GM}{r}
$$
This equation is only applicable to circular orbits, but inserting the semi-major axis, $a$, instead of $r$ will enable us to calculate an average figure of orbital speed (the rms speed):
$$
\bar{v^{2}}=\frac{GM}{a}
$$
