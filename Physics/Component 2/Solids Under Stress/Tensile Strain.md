The bar shown below, of length $l$ and cross-sectional area $A$, is stretched by $\Delta l$, which requires a force $F$

Imagine two identical bars being welded end to end, making the total length $2l$, and the same stretching force is applied. The [[tension]] has the same value, $F$, in each half of the composite bar, so each half extends by $\Delta l$, making the total extension $2\delta l$
![[Tensile Strain 2024-03-24 15.03.35.excalidraw]]
From this we can conclude that if we have two bars with the same composition, cross-sectional area and tension, the ratio $\frac{\Delta l}{l}$ is the same. This quantity is called the tensile strain, $\epsilon$:
$$
\epsilon = \frac{\Delta l}{l}
$$
