Rubber is a polymeric material (polymerised isoprene, $\ce{ CH_{2}=C(CH_{3})CH=CH_{2} }$) with monomer:
```smiles
C=CC(=C)C
```
And section of polymer:
```smiles
CC=C(C)CCC=C(C)CCC=C(C)CCC=C(C)C
```
and consists of many $\ce{ C-C }$ bonds which have [[Shapes of Molecules|bond angles]] of $109.5^{\circ}$ so the natural shape is randomly tangled like below

When a rubber molecule is placed under [[tension]], it responds by straightening out and looking more like the polymer shown above. This extension allows the rubber to stretch to several times its original length. The force required is much less than when stretching [[ductile]] or [[amorphous materials]] because bonds are not being stretched, just rotated. The presence of cross-linkages  between molecules or just the entanglement of different molecules limits the total extension possible. The thermal motions of the atoms in the molecules, which tend to randomise the shape, provide opposition to the extension, i.e. the stiffness
When the tension is removed, random molecular motions of the atoms within the molecules re-randomises the shape of the molecules, leading to rubber contracting. Some energy is converted by intermolecular collisions into random kinetic energy of the molecules, leading to the [[hysteresis]] effect
Material scientist often introduce $\ce{ S-S }$ cross linkages into rubber in order to make it stiffer, this process is called vulcanisation
