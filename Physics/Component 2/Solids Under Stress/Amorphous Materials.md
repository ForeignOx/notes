Amorphous materials do not have a crystalline structure, so there is no long term order. These materials tend to be brittle because there can be no dislocations to move and produce [[plastic deformation]]
Brittle materials can be used in load-bearing structures if the brittle member is either always under compression or compressively pre-stressed in manufacture
