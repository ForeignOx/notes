When an object is subject to a [[Tension|tensile force]], it stretches. For most objects, extension of the stretched object is directly proportional to the tension - at least for small extensions
This can be written as:
$$
F=kx
$$
where $F$ is the tension, and $k$ is the spring constant, which has units of $\pu{ Nm-1 }$
Another way of writing this is to use the modulus of elasticity (aka the [[Young Modulus]]):
$$
\lambda=kl
$$
where $l$ is the natural length of the string (the string when no forces are applied to it).
 $$
F=\frac{~\lambda x}{l}
$$
This assumes the string is [[Light|light]], the system has no friction and the [[Elastic Limit|elastic limit]] has not been exceeded
Where Hooke's Law applies, the object also exhibits [[Elastic Materials|elastic]] behaviour. If an object is subject to too great a [[Types of Stress|stress]], it will fracture but, often before that happens, the tension-extension graph ceases to be linear. Some objects, particularly made of [[ductile]] metals, enter a [[Plastic Deformation|plastic]] region, in which they are permanently deformed by the tension

Work done stretching one $\delta x=F\delta x=kx\delta x$,  and so total [[work]] done $=\sum kx\delta x$, so [[elastic potential energy]] can be written as:
$$

\int _{0}^x kx\, dx=\frac{1}{2}kx^2=\frac{\lambda x^2}{2l}
$$
