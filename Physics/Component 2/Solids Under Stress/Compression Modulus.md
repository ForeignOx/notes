The compression modulus is pretty much the same as the [[Young modulus]], except for compression instead of tension, so the compression modulus is the [[compressive stress]] divided by the [[compressive strain]]. And since these are essentially the same as the [[tensile stress]] and [[tensile strain]], the compression modulus is essentially the same as the Young modulus
