When pressure is exerted on a point on an [[Amorphous Materials|amorphous material]], the interatomic forces cannot cross the gap because the atoms are too far apart, so the forces must be transmitted around the tip of the crack, leading to a greatly magnified [[Tensile Stress|stress]]. The brittle material starts to break at the crack  tip; the crack extends which increases the stress at the tip and so the crack propagates, resulting in catastrophic failure
