The [[tension]], $F$, extension, $\Delta l$, and [[Physics/Component 2/Solids Under Stress/Hooke's Law|spring constant]], $k$, relate to a specific object, so it is useful to have a quantity which can be used to predict the properties of many different objects, the Young modulus
If a bar obeys [[Hooke's Law]], then $F \propto\Delta l$, so from the definition of [[tensile stress]] and [[tensile strain]], it must be true that $\sigma \propto \epsilon$, so we define the Young modulus, $E$, of the material by:
$$
E=\frac{\sigma}{\epsilon}=\frac{Fl}{A\Delta l}
$$
