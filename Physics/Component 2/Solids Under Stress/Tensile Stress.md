The bar shown below, of length $l$ and cross-sectional area $A$, is stretched by $\delta l$, which requires a force $F$

If we imagine two such bars side by side, making a total cross-sectional area of $2A$, each will require $F$ to stretch it by $\delta l$, so the total tension is $2F$

From this we can conclude that if we have two bars of the same composition and length, it will be stretched by the same amount if the ration $\frac{F}{A}$ is the same. This quantity is known as the tensile stress, $\sigma$
$$
\sigma=\frac{F}{A}
