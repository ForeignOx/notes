[[Ductile]] metals tend to have [[Tensile Stress|stress]]-[[Tensile Strain|strain]] graphs similar to this:
![[Pasted image 20240324170348.png]]
- The linear potion OA is where [[Hooke's Law]] holds. The gradient of this section is the [[Young modulus]]. Point A is the  limit of proportionality
- Point B is the [[elastic limit]], beyond B, all deformations are [[Plastic Deformation|plastic]]
- Point C is the yield point, where the material shows a large increase in strain for little or no increase in stress. The stress here is called the yield stress
- Point D is known as the ultimate stress point
- The region DE is where the metal exhibits a phenomenon known as necking, which is a narrowing region where it will eventually break
- Point E is the breaking point, and the stress here is the breaking stress or the ultimate tensile strength
