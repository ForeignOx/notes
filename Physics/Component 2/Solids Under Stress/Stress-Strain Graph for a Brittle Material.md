Brittle [[Amorphous Materials|amorphous]] materials tend to have [[Tensile Stress|stress]]-[[Tensile Strain|strain]] graphs similar to this:

Due to the [[Giant Covalent Structures|covalent]] nature of many brittle materials, atoms are bonded by shared electrons, which cannot swap bonding to another atom, so [[Plastic Deformation]] is not possible. The points where brittle materials fracture are usually caused by [[Crack Propagation|crack propagations]]
