Metals are crystalline, they have a periodic structure called a lattice. The lattice particles in metals are positive [[ions]], which are held together by a 'sea' of delocalised electrons, causing [[Metallic Bonding|metallic bonding]]. Because metal ions are spheres, they pack with the least potential energy into planes with hexagonal arrangement

Most metals are polycrystalline, so when they solidify from the molten state, crystallisation occurs at many points independently. This results in a large number of very small interlocking crystals known as grains which look like this:
