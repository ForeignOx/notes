An important feature of the [[Structure of Ductile Metals]] is the presence of irregularities within the lattice. An edge dislocation looks like this

When a deformation shown in the image above occurs, the change is irreversible, so this is a [[Plastic Deformation]]. At the end, the grain becomes more elongated, and the [[Tensile Stress|stress]] at which this occurs is the yield stress, the details of what happens next depends on several factors. Edge dislocations can get entangled, larger grains have more freedom of movement, and [[Point Defects]] can inhibit the movement
