Entropy (S) is the number of ways that [[Energy]] can be shared out between [[Particle Model|particles]], it is a measure of disorder in a system, the more disorder there is, the higher the entropy
Solids have the lowest level of disorder, as particles are arranged neatly. Liquids and then gases are then more disordered and so have higher entropy. The number of particles also affects entropy change. If a reaction is in the same state, but more moles are produced, then entropy increases as there are more ways energy can be distributed
Entropy change ($\Delta S$) between reactants and products can be calculated like so:
$$
\Delta S=S_\text{products}-S_\text{reactants}
$$
If $\Delta S>0$, then the reaction is entropically feasible
