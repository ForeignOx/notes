A reaction can be spontaneous (feasible) even if it is enthalpically unfavourable ([[Endothermic Reactions|endothermic]])
A reaction will tend towards more disorder, and hence increase [[Entropy]]. Increasing entropy is energetically favourable and some reactions that are enthalpically unfavourable can still spontaneously react if changes in entropy overcome changes in [[Enthalpy]]
