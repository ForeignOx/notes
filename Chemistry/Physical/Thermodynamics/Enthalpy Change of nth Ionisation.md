Ionisation energy is the minimum amount of [[Energy]] to remove 1 mole of electrons from 1 mole of atoms in the gaseous state
Enthalpy change of $n$th ionisation energy $\Delta_{ien}H$, is the [[Enthalpy]] change when 1 mole of gaseous $n+$ [[Ions]] are made from 1 mole of gaseous $(n-1)+$ ions/atoms
