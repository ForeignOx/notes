Aka $\Delta _\text{solution}H$, it is the [[enthalpy]] change when 1 mole of an [[Ionic bonding|ionic]] substance is dissolved in the minimum amount of solvent to ensure no further enthalpy change is observed upon further dilution

For a substance to dissolve, substance bonds must break ([[Endothermic Reactions|endothermic]]) then new bonds must be formed ([[Exothermic Reactions|exothermic]]). The [[Ionic compounds|ionic]] lattice starts in solid form, then the bonds are broken to create free moving ions. Then bonds are formed between [[ions]] and water, the ions are hydrated

Most ionic compounds dissolve in polar solvents like $\ce{ H_{2}O }$, the $\delta+$ H ion is attracted to the negative ions, the $\delta-$ oxygen is attracted to positive ions
For this to happen, the new bonds formed must be the same strength or greater than those broken, if not, then the substance is very unlikely to dissolve
