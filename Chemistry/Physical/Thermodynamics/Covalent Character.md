Theoretical and experimental values of lattice [[Enthalpy|enthalpies]] can be different depending on how 'purely [[Ionic bonding|ionic]]' the compound is. This is because theoretical lattice enthalpies can be calculated from data assuming a perfectly ionic model. That is that [[ions]] are perfectly spherical and charge is evenly distributed in the spheres (point charges)

Experimental values are calculated by doing experiments, and are often different to the theoretical value. This tells us that the compound being experimented on doesn't follow the perfectly ionic model and has some [[Covalent bond|covalent]] character. This is because most of the time, the positive ion distorts the charge distribution in the negative ion. We say the positive ion polarises the negative ion

The more polarisation there is, the more covalent character there will be
