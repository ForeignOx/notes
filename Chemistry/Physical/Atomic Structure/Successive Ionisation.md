The removal of more than 1 electron from the same atom is called successive ionisation, i.e. the $n^{th}$ [[Enthalpy Change of nth Ionisation|ionisation energy]]. The graph for the successive ionisation of $\ce{Mg}$ looks like:

There is a general increase in energy as the nucleus is more positive each time, due to [[Nuclear Charge|nuclear charge]] but there are also two jumps at 3 and 11, this is because the electrons being removed are from a shell that is closer to the nucleus, so the [[Atomic Size|atomic radius]] is smaller.
