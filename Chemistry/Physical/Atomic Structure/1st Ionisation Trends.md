## Groups

[[Enthalpy Change of nth Ionisation|Ionisation energy]] decreases as we go down a group. This is because the [[Atomic Size|atomic radius]] increases as we go down a group. [[Electron shielding]] also increases as we go down the group. 
This data provides strong evidence for shells in atoms and shows [[History of the atom#^9264ce|Niels Bohr's]] model of the atom is accurate
## Periods
![[Pasted image 20240131211036.png]]
Generally, the ionisation energy increases as you go across a period. This is because there are an increasing number of protons in the nucleus, increasing the [[Nuclear Charge|nuclear attraction]]. [[electron shielding]] is very similar across the period, and the [[Atomic Size|atomic radius]] marginally decreases.
The decrease at $\ce{Al}$ is evidence for atoms having [[Electron Configuration|subshells]], this is because the outer most electron in $\ce{Al}$ sits in a higher energy subshell, slightly further from the nucleus than the outer electron in $\ce{Mg}$, $\ce{Al}$ has a $3p^1$ electron. The atomic model Niels Bohr came up with didn't explain this theory.
There is also a decrease at $\ce{S}$, which provides evidence for electron repulsion in the orbital. This is because both $\ce{P}$ and $\ce{S}$ have outer electrons in the $3p$ orbital, so the [[Electron Shielding|shielding]] is the same. But, removing an electron from $\ce{S}$ requires taking it from an orbital with 2 electrons in. Electrons repel each other, so less energy is needed to remove an electron from an orbital with 2 in than with 1 in like with $\ce{P}$
