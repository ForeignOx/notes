## Nucleus
Contains most of the mass of an atom and is very small. It contains protons and neutrons
## Electrons
Orbit the nucleus in shells and take most of the space of an atom
## Particles and their properties
| Subatomic Particle | Relative Charge | Relative Mass |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Proton | +1 | 1 |
| Neutron | 0 | 1 |
| Electron | -1 | 1/2000 |
## Mass Number (A)
Is defined as the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of a given atom
## Atomic number (Z)
Aka the proton number Is defined as the number of protons in the nucleus of a given atom, this defines an element
## Neutrality of atoms
All atoms are neutral, so the number of protons = number of electrons
