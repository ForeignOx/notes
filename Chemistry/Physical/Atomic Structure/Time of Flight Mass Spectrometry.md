To measure the atomic mass of a compound, time of flight (TOF) mass spectrometry can be used. It happens in a series of steps:
## 1. Vaporisation
The sample is vaporised so it can travel through the TOF mass spectrometer
## 2. Ionisation
The sample is pushed through a nozzle making a high pressure jet. A high voltage is passed through causing the loss of an electron. Then a gaseous positively charged sample is produced, this is called electrospray ionisation
## 3. Acceleration
The positive ions are passed through an [[Electric Fields|electric field]]. Particles with lower mass/charge ($m/z$) ratio will accelerate faster
## 4. Ion Drift
Particles through with a constant speed and [[Kinetic Energy|kinetic energy]]. They drift through and particles with lower $m/z$ ratios travel faster
## 5. Detection
Ions are detected as electrical current is made when the particle hits the plate. Particles with lower $m/z$ reach the detector first as they travel fastest
