## For Isotopes

The abundance is always shown on the y-axis, it is always a proportion, the sum of all the proportions of the [[Isotopes|isotopes]] must sum to 1.
$\frac{m}{z}$ is just the mass of an isotope divided by charge. As most have a +1 charge, this is the same as the [[Relative Isotopic Mass|isotopic mass]].
This spectrum shows 2 isotopes of one element, there are 75% isotopes with mass 35, and 25% isotopes with mass 37 (assuming they all have a +1 charge). From this we can work out the [[Relative Atomic Mass (Ar)|relative atomic mass]] using the formula:
$$
\text{Relative atomic mass}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \text{Abundance}_{i} \times\left( \frac{m}{z} \right)_{i}}{\text{Total Abundance}}
$$
## For molecules

Peaks of these show fragments of the original molecule, the last peak is known as the M+ peak, or the molecular ion peak. This is the same as the [[Relative Molecular Mass (Mr)|relative molecular mass]] of the molecule
