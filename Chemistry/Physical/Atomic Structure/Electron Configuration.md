Electron shells are split into 4 subshells:
$s$: has 1 orbital and can hold 2 electrons
$p$: has 3 orbitals and can hold 6 electrons
$d$: has 5 orbitals and can hold 10 electrons
$f$: has 7 orbitals and can hold 14 electrons
These orbitals are represented on the periodic table like so:

Electron configurations are written like so:
$$
xs^n
$$
where $x$ is the shell number or period, $s$ tells you the subshell, and $n$ tells you the number of electrons

This is the order electrons fill shells with increasing energy

This in theory is an easy way to remember the order
### Atoms
The electron configuration of $\ce{Fe}$ is:
$$
1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^63d^64s^2
$$
note that the $3d^6$ is written before the $4s^2$ even though it is not complete, this is because you order them by shell number you can also write the most recent noble gas in square brackets and the electrons after that. So you could also write the electron configuration of $\ce{Fe}$ as $\ce{[Ar]}3d^64s^2$
### Ions
Ions are the same usually, you just add or remove electrons depending on the charge.
### Transition metals
Chromium and Copper behave differently however, an electron from the $4s$ orbital moves to the $3d$ orbital, so $\ce{Cr}$ is $\ce{[Ar]}3d^54s^1$, and $\ce{Cu}$ is $\ce{[Ar]}3d^{10}4s^1$. This is because the paired electrons in the $s$ orbital repel each other, so the $d$ orbital is more stable
