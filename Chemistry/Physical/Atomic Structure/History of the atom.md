## 1903 John Dalton

John Dalton said that [[The Atom|atoms]] are spheres and each element is made from a different sphere
## 1897 J.J. Thomson

J.J. Thomson discovered the electron. The atom wasn't solid, and was made up of other particles. He said that there were negative electrons that were contained in a positive sphere. this is known as the 'plum pudding' model
## 1909 Ernest Rutherford

Ernest Rutherford discovered the nucleus, and that that it was very small (compared to the rest of the atom) and positively charged. He also concluded that the atom was mainly empty space making up a negative 'cloud'
### Gold leaf experiment
He made this discovery by firing $\alpha$ particles at thin gold leaf, most went through the gold leaf (showing that atoms are mainly empty space), but a small number deflected (they hit a small positive nucleus
## 1913 Niels Bohr

Discovered that there was a problem with Rutherford's model; the cloud of electrons could collapse into the positive nucleus, he proposed the electrons we in fixed energy shells.
### Experimental proof
When [[Electromagnetic Radiation|electromagnetic radiation]] is absorbed, electrons move to a higher energy level, when it is emitted, electrons move to a lower energy level, and thus electrons must exist in shells
