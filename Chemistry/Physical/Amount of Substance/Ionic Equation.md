Ionic equations show the [[Ions]] that are formed in solution and show which particles are reacting. Normally acids, bases and salts form ions in solution
### Example
Here is a standard balanced equation for an acid reacting with a base. 
$$
\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} +2KOH->K_{2}SO_{4} +2H_{2}O }
$$
Which can be written in terms of ions like so (water can be left as it is)
$$
\ce{ 2H+ +SO_{4}^{2-} +2K+ +2OH- -> 2K+ +SO_{4}^{2-} +2H_{2}O }
$$
Then cancel any ions which appear on both sides of the equation to form the simplest ionic equation
$$
\ce{ 2H+ +2OH- -> 2H_{2}O }
$$
This is the full ionic equation, where the charges must balance on left and right side of the equation
Here, $\ce{ SO_{4}^{2-} }$ and $\ce{ K+}$ are [[Spectator Ions]]
