Titrations can be used to work out the concentration of an acid or alkali:
![[Titrations 2024-02-03 14.34.57.excalidraw]]
## Process
1. Have an acid or alkali in burette with a known concentration
2. Have an acid or alkali with an unknown concentration, but known volume in a conical flask with a few drops of desired [[Common indicators|indicator]]
3. Add the chemical in the burette to the conical flask until the indicator changes colour. This is known as the end point make sure to add dropwise near the end point
4. Record how much chemical was added from the burette to neutralise the chemical in the conical flask, remember to read the bottom of the meniscus at eye level
5. Record results to 2dp. and repeat until you get two concordant results (within 0.1$\pu{ cm3 }$ of each other)
## Calculations
Titrations can be used to work out the volume/concentration of an acid or alkali, using these steps:
1. Write out the equation and balance it
2. Calculate the number of moles of substance in burette
3. Use the equation and mole ration to work out the number of moles of the substance in the conical flask
4. Now calculate volume/concentration using moles

## Concentrations of [[Brønsted–Lowry Acids|Acids]] and [[Brønsted–Lowry Bases|Bases]]
Titrations can be sued to work out the concentration of an acid or a base:
1. Have and acid or base in burette with a known concentration
2. Have an acid or base with an unknown concentration but known volume in the conical flask with a few drops of a suitable indicator
3. Add the chemical in the burette to the conical flask until the indicator changes colour, this is known as the end point
4. Read how much chemical was added to neutralise the chemical in the conical flask
