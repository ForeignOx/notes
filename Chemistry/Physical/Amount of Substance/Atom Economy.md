Atom economy is a measure of how efficient a reaction is in terms of reactants used. The equation for percentage atom economy is:
$$
\%\text{ Atom Economy}=\frac{\text{molecular mass of desired product}}{\text{sum of molecular masses of all reactants} }\times 100
$$
- Companies will try to use reactions that tend towards 100% atom economy
- High atom economies produce less waste, and so benefit the environment
- High atom economies mean that raw materials are used more efficiently which is more sustainable
- Higher atom economy means fewer by-products so less time and money is spent separating these from the desirable product
