When chemists measure out an amount of a substance, they use an amount in moles. The mole is a useful quantity because one mole of a substance always contains the same number of entities of the substance. An amount in moles can be measured out by mass in grams, by volume in $\pu{dm3  }$ of a solution of known concentration and by volume in $\pu{ dm3 }$ of a gas.
