The mole is a way of measuring amount of substance in chemistry, 1 mole has a unit of one $\pu{ mol }$. 1 mole of any substance contains $6.022\times 10^{23}$ atoms/molecules. This is known as Avogadro's Number.
We can calculate the number of particles in a substance using the formula:
$$
\text{Number of particles}=\text{Number of moles}\times 6.022\times 10^{23}
$$
The number of moles can be calculated using the formula:
$$
\text{Moles}=\frac{\text{Mass (g)}}{\text{Mr}}
$$
The number of moles of a solution can also be calculated using the formula:
$$
\text{Moles}=\text{Concentration }(\pu{ moldm-3 } )\times \text{Volume }(\pu{dm3  })
$$
