Empirical formula is the simplest whole number ratio of elements in a compound,  this can be used to work out compounds from percentages of elements of a compound using these steps:
1. Write out the elements involved
2. Write out the percentages as masses
3. Divide these by [[Relative Atomic Mass (Ar)|relative atomic]] mass to get number of moles
4. Divide all the numbers by the smallest number of moles
You can also work out the molecular formula by dividing by the [[Relative Molecular Mass (Mr)|Mr]] of the molecular formula and using this number to multiply all the atoms in the empirical formula
### Example
A compound contains $23.3\%\ce{ Mg }$, $30.7\%\ce{ S }$ and $46.0\%\ce{ O }$, what is the empirical formula of this compound?

| Mg | S | O |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 23.3g | 30.7g | 46.0g |
| 0.96 | 0.96 | 2.88 |
| 1 | 1 | 3 |
Hence the empirical formula is $\ce{ MgSO_{3} }$
