Low pressure gases which are well above their boiling points behave in a very simple way. Such gases are referred to as ideal gases
If we investigate the relationships between the pressure $p$, volume $V$ and the temperature in kelvin $T$, we find that:
- At a constant temperature, $p \propto \frac{1}{V}\implies pV=k$ (Boyles Law)
- At a constant pressure, $V \propto T\implies \frac{V}{T}=k$ (Charles' Law)
- At a constant volume, $p \propto T\implies \frac{p}{T}=k$ (Pressure Law)
These can be combined to give the relationship (for a fixed sample of gas):
$$
pV \propto T
$$
Writing this as $pV=kT$, the constant $k$ will be proportional to the amount of gas present. Combining this with [[Avogadro's Law]], we can say:
$$
pV=nRT
$$
where $p$ is pressure in $\pu{ Pa }$, $V$ is volume in $\pu{ m3 }$, $n$ is he number of moles in $\pu{ mol }$, $R$ is the gas constant which has a value of $8.31\pu{ JK-1mol-1 }$, and $T$ is temperature in $\pu{K }$
No gas exactly obeys the ideal gas equation, but common gases do to a very good approximation under everyday conditions and as do other gases at very low pressure
