Exothermic reactions are reactions that release energy to the surroundings

[[Enthalpy]] of products is lower than that of reactants ($\Delta H<0$)
Combustion is a common example of an exothermic reaction
When bonds are formed, energy is released, so making bonds is an exothermic process as $\Delta H<0$
If more energy is released when bonds are formed than what was needed to break initial bonds, the reaction will be exothermic
