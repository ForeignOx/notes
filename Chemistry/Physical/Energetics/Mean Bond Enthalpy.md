Bond [[enthalpy]] is the amount of energy stored in a bond, i.e. how much energy is needed to break or form that type of bond, but bonds of the same type don't all have the same amount of energy, so we need to take an average
For example, in methane there are 4 C-H bonds which all have slightly different enthalpies, as the energy needed to break the first one will be different to the energy needed to break the second one
We can measure enthalpy of breaking all 4 bonds and divide by 4 to get a mean bond enthalpy of a C-H bond
$$
\Delta H=\text{Total energy to break bonds}-\text{Total energy released by forming bonds}
$$
