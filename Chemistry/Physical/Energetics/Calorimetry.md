Calorimetry is used to work out the [[enthalpy change of combustion]]

A fuel is burned to raise the temperature of the water by a specific amount. Generally we weigh the fuel before and after burning to work out the mass of fuel burned
A lid is typically placed on top to prevent heat loss and wind shields are placed by the flame to prevent draught from moving the flame, a polystyrene cup can be used to prevent heat loss
The energy from the fuel is transferred into the water although some is lost to the surroundings too
Energy transferred can be calculated using
$$
q=mc\Delta T
$$
Where $q$ is heat energy lost or gained (in $\pu{ J}$), $m$ is the mass of solution (typically water) (in $\pu{ g }$), $c$ is the specific heat capacity of the solution (for water it is $\pu{ 4.18Jg-1K-1 }$), and $\Delta T$ is the temperature change (in $\pu{ K}$)
Enthalpy is in $\pu{ Jmol-1 }$, so we need to divide $q$ by the number of moles of the burnt solution to calculate the enthalpy change
