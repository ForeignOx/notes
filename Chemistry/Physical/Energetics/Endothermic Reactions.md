Reactions that absorb energy from the surroundings
![[Pasted image 20240229091328.png]]
[[Enthalpy]] of products is higher than reactants ($\Delta H>0$)
Thermal decomposition is an example of an endothermic reaction
To break a bond, energy needs to be absorbed, so bonds breaking is an endothermic process, so $\Delta H>0$
If more energy is needed to break bonds than energy given out when bonds are formed the reaction will be endothermic
