When a chemical reaction occurs, there is normally a change in energy
The enthalpy change of a reaction is the heat change in a reaction at a constant pressure, it is given the symbol $\Delta H^{\theta}$, (change in enthalpy) and has units of $\pu{ kJmol-1 }$, the $\theta$ means the substance was in the standard state under [[standard conditions]]
