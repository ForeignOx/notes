If you are given [[Enthalpy Change of Formation|formation]] data, you draw a formation cycle
![[Hess's Cycle for Formation 2024-02-29 11.00.25.excalidraw]]
If you go with an arrow, you keep the sign the same, if you go against the arrow, you change the sign. Enthalpy of formation of elements is always 0. Using [[Hess's Law]] you can work out one of the other stages
