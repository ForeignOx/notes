A [[The Mole|mole]] fraction is the proportion of gas in a gas mixture:
$$
\text{Mole fraction of a gas}=\frac{\text{number of moles of gas}}{\text{total number of moles of gas in the mixture}}
$$
For example take a general equation:
$$
\ce{ 2A_{(g)}->B_{\text{(g)}} +C_{\text{(g)}} }
$$
There are a total of 4 moles of gas, two of which are $A$, so the mole fraction of $A$ is $\frac{2}{4}=\frac{1}{2}$
