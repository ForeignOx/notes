[[Partial Pressure|Partial pressures]] are used to calculate the gas [[Dynamic Equilibrium|equilibrium]] constant $K_{p}$
For a general reaction:
$$
\ce{ \alpha A_{\text{(g)}} +\beta B_{\text{(g)}} <=> \gamma C_{\text{(g)}} + \delta D_{\text{(g)}}}
$$
$$
K_\text{p}=\frac{(p(C))^{\gamma}(p(D))^{\delta}}{(p(A))^{\alpha}(p(B))^{\beta}}
$$
## Temperature affecting $K_{p}$
$K_{p}$ is only valid for one temperature, changing the temperature will change equilibrium pressures, hence $K_{p}$ will change too, the change can be worked out using the [[Ideal Gas Equation]], generally, by [[Le Chatelier's Principle]], if a temperature change causes equilibrium to shift right, $K_{p}$ will increase
## Pressure affecting $K_{p}$
The value of $K_{p}$ is unaffected by changes in pressure
## [[Catalyst|Catalysts]] affecting $K_{p}$
Adding a catalyst has no effect on the value of $K_{p}$ as it speeds up the rate of forward and backward reaction equally, catalysts simply speed up the rate at which equilibrium is established
