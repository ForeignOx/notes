Strong [[Brønsted–Lowry Bases|bases]] dissociate almost completely, but when calculating the [[pH]] of a strong base, you assume it dissociates fully
Most strong bases dissociate to produce one $\ce{ OH- }$ [[ions|ion]] for every base molecule. This means that the concentration of the base is equal to the concentration of the $\ce{ OH- }$ ions
We can calculate the concentration of $\ce{ H+ }$ by using the [[ionic product of water]] $K_{w}$ expression:
$$
[\ce{ H+ }]=\frac{K_{w}}{[\ce{ OH- }]}
$$
