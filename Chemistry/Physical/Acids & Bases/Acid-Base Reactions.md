When [[Brønsted–Lowry Acids|acids]] and [[Brønsted–Lowry Bases|bases]] react with each other, protons are exchanged. In this generic example the acid ($HA$) donates a proton to the base ($B$). Positive and negative [[ions]] are produced:
$$
\ce{ HA_{\text{(aq)}} +B_{\text{(aq)}} <=> BH+_{\text{(aq)}} +A-_{\text{(aq)}} }
$$
This reaction is in [[Dynamic Equilibrium|equilibrium]], hence follows [[Le Chatelier's Principle]], for strong acids, equilibrium lies to the right, for weak acids, equilibrium lies to the left
Water behaves as a base when an acid is added to it
