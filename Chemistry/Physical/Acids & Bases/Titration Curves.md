The following graphs show [[pH]] against volume of a [[Brønsted–Lowry Bases|base]] added (but titration curves can be with volume of [[Brønsted–Lowry Acids|acid]] added) from a [[titration]] for different combinations of weak and strong acids and bases
## [[Strong Acids|Strong Acid]] with [[Strong Bases|Strong Base]]
![[Pasted image 20240317212627.png]]
The graph starts at pH 1 as there is excess strong acid and ends at around pH 13 as, by the end, there is excess strong base. Methyl Orange is a good indicator for this titration
## [[Strong Acids|Strong Acid]] with Weak Base
![[Pasted image 20240317213010.png]]
The graph starts at pH 1 as there is excess strong acid and ends at around pH 9 as, by the end, there is excess weak base. Methyl Orange is a good indicator for this titration
## [[Weak Acids|Weak Acid]] with [[Strong Bases|Strong Base]]
![[Pasted image 20240317213332.png]]
The graph starts at around pH 5 as there is excess weak acid and ends at around pH 13 as, by the end, there is excess strong base. Phenolphthalein is a good indicator for this titration
## [[Weak Acids|Weak Acid]] with Weak Base
![[Pasted image 20240317213400.png]]
The graph starts at around pH 5 as there is excess weak acid and ends at around pH 9 as, by the end, there is an excess of weak base. Due to the shape of the graph, there is no suitable indicator for this titration as there is no sharp pH change, so a pH probe is needed
## Features of a titration curve
![[Titration Curves 2024-03-17 21.46.11.excalidraw]]
The equivalence point or end point is the point where the acid has been neutralised fully by the base, the sharp vertical rise shows a rapid change in pH, this change is less rapid when a weak acid and weak base are used, so the equivalence point is harder to gauge
The half neutralisation point is the point half way between zero and the equivalence point, it can be used to calculate the [[pKa]] of a weak acid using the pH. This is because at this point half of the acid will have dissociated, so $\ce{ [HA]=[A-] }$, so, using the [[acid dissociation constant]]
$$
K_{a}=\frac{\ce{ [H+][A-] }}{\ce{ [HA] }}
$$
Which can be simplified to:
$$
K_{a}=\ce{ [H+] }
$$
$$
\implies \text{p}K_{a}=\text{pH}
$$
## Diprotic Titration Curves
Diprotic acids release 2 protons when they dissociate in solution, but the protons are released separately, so the graph titration curve will show 2 equivalence points
