Water exists in [[Dynamic Equilibrium|equilibrium]] with its [[Ions]], water dissociates into hydroxide ions and hydroxonium ions:
$$
\ce{ 2H_{2}O <=> H_{3}O+ +OH- }
$$
[[Kc Equilibrium Constant|Kc]] for this reaction is given like so:
$$
K_{c}=\frac{\ce{ [H+][OH-] }}{[\ce{ H_{2}O }]}
$$
However, water dissociates into its ions very weakly. In fact there are so few $\ce{ OH- }$ and $\ce{ H+ }$ ions compared with $\ce{ H_{2}O }$ molecules that we assume that the concentration of water has a constant value. Using this fact we can get a new constant, $K_{w}$ (the ionic product of water):
$$
K_{w}=\ce{ [H+][OH-] }
$$
The value of $K_{w}$ is the same in a solution at a given temperature. At $298\pu{ K }$, $K_{w}$ has a value of $1.00\times 10^{-14}\pu{ mol^{2}dm-6 }$
Pure water has an equal concentration of $\ce{ H+ }$ and $\ce{ OH- }$ ions, in other words, $\ce{ [H+]=[OH-] }$, so we can simplify the expression to:
$$
K_{w}=[\ce{ H+ }]^{2}
$$
