Strong [[Brønsted–Lowry Acids|acids]] dissociate almost completely, but when calculating the [[pH]] of strong acids, you assume they dissociate fully
## Monoprotic acids
Monoprotic acids dissociate to produce one $\ce{ H+ }$ [[Ions|ion]] for every acid molecule, meaning the concentration of the acid is equal to the concentration of the $\ce{ H+ }$ ions
## Diprotic acids
Diprotic acids dissociate to produce two $\ce{ H+ }$ ions for every acid molecule. This means that the concentration of the acid is half the concentration of the $\ce{ H+ }$ ions
