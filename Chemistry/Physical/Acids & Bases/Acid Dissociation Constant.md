Weak [[Brønsted–Lowry Acids|acids]] exist in the following equilibrium:
$$
\ce{ HA <=> H+ +A- }
$$
From this we can get an expression for the [[Kc Equilibrium Constant|equilibrium constant]] to get an acid dissociation constant $K_{a}$:
$$
K_{a}=\frac{\ce{ [H+][A-] }}{\ce{ [HA]_\text{equilibrium} }}
$$
And since only a small amount of the [[Weak Acids|weak acid]] dissociates, we can assume that $\ce{ [HA]_{equilibrium} }\approx \ce{ [HA]_{start} }$. Also the dissociation of acid is greater than the dissociation of water in the solution, so we can assume that all the $\ce{ H+ }$ [[ions]] come from the acid, hence $\ce{ [H+] }\approx[\ce{ A- }]$ hence the expression can be rewritten as:
$$
K_{a}=\frac{\ce{ [H+] }^{2}}{[\ce{ HA }]}
$$
However this cannot be used for buffers
