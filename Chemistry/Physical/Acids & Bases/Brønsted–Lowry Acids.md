Brønsted–Lowry acids are proton donors, so when we mix acids with water, hydrogen [[ions]] are released. $\ce{ H+ }$ ions don't exist on their own in water, they form hydroxonium ions ($\ce{ H_{3}O+ }$). It is these ions that make a solution acidic, however, for simplicity we just write $\ce{ H+ }$ in equations. An example equation for an acid reacting with water (with $HA$ denoting an acid) is:
$$
\ce{ HA_{\text{(aq)}} +H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} -> H_{3}O+_{\text{(aq)}} +A-_{\text{(aq)}} }
$$
[[Strong acids]] dissociate (ionise) almost completely. Weak acids dissociate poorly
