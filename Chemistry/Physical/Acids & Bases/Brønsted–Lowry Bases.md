Brønsted–Lowry bases are proton acceptors, when they are mixed with water, they will react with the $\ce{ H+ }$ [[Ions]] to form hydroxide ions. An example equation with $B$ representing a base is:
$$
\ce{ B_{\text{(aq)}} +H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} -> BH+_{\text{(aq)}} +OH-_{\text{(aq)}}}
$$
[[Strong Bases]] dissociate (ionise) almost completely. Weak bases dissociate poorly
