Acidic [[Buffers]] resist the change in [[pH]] in order to keep the solution below pH 7. They are made from a [[Weak Acids|weak acid]] and its salt
In the buffer solution there are 2 [[Dynamic Equilibrium|equilibrium]] reaction co-existing:
$$
\ce{ HA_{\text{(aq)}} <=> A-_{\text{(aq)}} +H+_{\text{(aq)}} }
$$
Weak acid dissociates weakly, so in this reaction, the equilibrium lies to the left
Denoting the metal in the salt as $\ce{ M+ }$, the other reaction is:
$$
\ce{ A^-M+_{\text{(aq)}}<=> A-_{\text{(aq)}} +M+_{\text{(aq)}} }
$$
Salts dissociate strongly, so the equilibrium lies to the right
## Adding an [[Brønsted–Lowry Acids|Acid]]
When an acid is added to the buffer, the $\ce{ H+ }$ [[Ions]] react with the $\ce{ A- }$ ions in the solution. There is a high concentration of these from the salt. The $\ce{ HA }$ produced means that the equilibrium of the first reaction shifts to the left
## Adding a [[Brønsted–Lowry Bases|Base]]
When a base is added to the buffer, the $\ce{ OH- }$ ions react with the $\ce{ H+ }$ ions in solution. There is a low concentration of these, but they are reproduced due to [[Le Chatelier's Principle]], which will attempt to counteract the change, so the equilibrium of the first reaction shifts to the right
## Calculating pH of a buffer solution
To calculate the pH of a buffer, you need to know the $K_{a}$ value and the concentrations of the weak acid and the salt. Start with the expression for the [[Acid Dissociation Constant]]:
$$
K_{a}=\frac{\ce{ [H+][A-] }}{\ce{ [HA] }}
$$
Which can be rearranged to:
$$
\ce{ [H+] } = \frac{K_{a}\times \ce{ [HA] }}{\ce{ [A-] }}
$$
Note that this assumes that salts dissociate fully and weak acids dissociate poorly, so $[\text{salt}]=\ce{ [A-]  }$ and $\ce{ [HA_\text{start}]=[HA_\text{equilibrium}] }$. From the above equation, we can calculate pH
## Calculating the pH change of a buffer solution
When a small amount of a [[Strong Acids|strong acid]] is added to a buffer, you start by working out the moles of the buffer's acid, the salt and the added acid. Then, assuming all the $\ce{ H+ }$ ions from the strong acid react with the salt's $\ce{ A- }$ ions, the amount of the buffer's acid, $\ce{ HA }$ increases by the amount of added acid and the amount of salt decreases by this amount. Next new concentrations of $\ce{ [HA] }$ and $[\ce{ A- }]$ need to be calculated since the volume and moles of the solution has changed. Then you calculate the pH of a buffer solution normally, like above
