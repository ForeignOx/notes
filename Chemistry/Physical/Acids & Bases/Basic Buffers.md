Basic [[Buffers]] resist the change in [[pH]] in order to keep the solution above pH 7. They are made from a weak base and its salt
In the buffer solution, there are 2 [[Dynamic Equilibrium|equilibrium]] equations that co-exist:
$$
\ce{ B_{\text{(aq)}} +H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} <=> BH+_{\text{(aq)}} +OH-_{\text{(aq)}} }
$$
The weak base produces very few $\ce{ OH- }$ [[Ions]], so the equilibrium lies to the left
Denoting the negative ion in the salt $\ce{ X- }$, the other reaction is:
$$
\ce{ BH+X-_{\text{(aq)}} <=> BH+_{\text{(aq)}} +X-_{\text{(aq)}} }
$$
The salt dissociates strongly, so the equilibrium lies to the right
## Adding a [[Brønsted–Lowry Bases|Base]]
When a base is added to the buffer, the $\ce{ OH- }$ ions will react with the $\ce{ BH+ }$ ions which are in high concentration due to the salt. This means that more $\ce{ B }$ and $\ce{ H_{2}O }$ are produced which means the equilibrium of the first reaction shifts to the left
## Adding an [[Brønsted–Lowry Acids|Acid]]
When an acid is added to the buffer, the $\ce{ H+ }$ ions react with the $\ce{ OH- }$ ions in solution. There is a low concentration of these however, they can be reproduced by [[Le Chatelier's Principle]] from the high concentration of $\ce{ B }$ and $\ce{ H_{2}O }$, so the equilibrium of the first reaction shifts to the right
