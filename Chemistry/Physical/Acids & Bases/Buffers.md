A buffer is a chemical that resists the change in [[pH]] when small amounts of [[Brønsted–Lowry Acids|acid]] or [[Brønsted–Lowry Bases|base]] are added
## Uses of buffers
### Shampoos
Shampoos are actually marginally acidic, with a pH of 5-6, hair becomes dry and damaged if exposed to alkaline conditions, so the buffer helps resist changes in pH to keep the hair strong
### Washing Powder
Biological washing powders contain enzymes which can only work efficiently at a specific pH. Buffers help to resist changes in pH to allow them to work in their optimum pH
### Blood
It is vital to make sure blood pH is maintained as close to pH 7.4 as possible. Our body systems rely on this, so a buffer is present in our blood to help. Carbon dioxide plays a big role here
