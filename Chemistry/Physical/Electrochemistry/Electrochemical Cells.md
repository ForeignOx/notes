Electrochemical cells are two solutions of metal ions dissolved in sulfate solution, with an electrode of the same metal, or platinum if that is not possible, connected by a voltmeter or circuit, and a [[Salt Bridge]]
In each of the half cells (the beakers), one of the solutions will be [[redox|oxidised]] and the other will be [[redox|reduced]], which will cause current to flow
Each half cell will have an [[Electrode Potential]], the one with the more negative electrode potential will be oxidised, the one with the more positive electrode potential will be reduced (NO PRoblem). The [[half equations]] for the oxidised atom and the reduced ion, call the $\ce{ O }$ and $\ce{ R }$ will look like this:
$$
\ce{ O_{\text{(s)}}->O^{n+}_{\text{(aq)}} +ne- }
$$
$$
\ce{ R^{n+}_{\text{(aq)}} +ne- -> R_{\text{(s)}}}
$$
