### IUPAC [[Electrochemical Cells|cell ]]diagrams
The [[Salt Bridge]] is represented by $| |$
A change in phase/state is represented by $|$
The most oxidised form of the ion goes next to the salt bridge (the form with the greatest charge)
Generally, the half cell with the greater [[Electrode Potential]] is written on the right 
If there are multiple species in the same states on one side of the salt bridge, then you separate them with a comma, and still put the most oxidised form closest to the electrode
