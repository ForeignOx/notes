You cannot measure the [[Electrode Potential]] of a half cell on its own, so values of standard electrode potentials are measured using a standard hydrogen electrode, which is said to have 0 volts
![[Standard Hydrogen Electrode 2024-03-15 16.43.57.excalidraw]]
A platinum electrode is used, hydrogen is bubbled through a solution with $\ce{ H+ }$ ions, such as $\ce{ HCl }$
If the hydrogen half cell is being oxidised, then the value of $V$ will be positive and the half cell equation for hydrogen will be:
$$
\ce{ H_{2}_{\text{(g)}} -> 2H+_{\text{(aq)}} +2e-}
$$
If the hydrogen half cell is being reduced, then the value of $V$ will be negative and the half cell equation will be:
$$
\ce{ 2H+_{\text{(aq)}} + 2e- \to H_{2}_{\text{(g)}} }
$$
The $\ce{ H_{2} }$ gas will be at [[standard conditions]], with a concentration of $\ce{ H+ }$ ions of $1.0\pu{ moldm-3 }$
The [[Standard Cell Notation]] for a hydrogen half cell is:
$$
\ce{ Pt_{\text{(s)}}|H_{2}_{\text{(g)}}|H+_{\text{(aq)}}| | }
$$
