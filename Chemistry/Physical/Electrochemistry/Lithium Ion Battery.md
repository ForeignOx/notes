Lithium ion batteries are a type of rechargeable [[Batteries|battery]]. These are the half equations at each electrode:
$$
\ce{ Li+ +e- <=> Li }\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, E^{\theta}=-3.04\pu{ V }  
$$
$$
\ce{ Li+ +CoO_{2} +e- <=> Li+[CoO_{2}]- }\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, E^{\theta}=+0.56\pu{ V } 
$$
[[redox|Oxidation]] happens in the first reaction as this has the most negative [[Electrode Potential]], hence the overall equation (for discharge) is:
$$
\ce{ Li + CoO_{2} <=> Li+[CoO_{2}]- }
$$
And $E^{\theta}_\text{cell}=0.56--3.04=3.6\pu{ V }$
To recharge the battery, you must simply supply a [[Electric Current|current]] which forces the electrons to flow in the opposite direction which reverses the overall discharge equation
