Fuel cells generate electricity using a continuous external supply of chemicals, rather than from a store like with [[Batteries]]
An alkaline hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell is an example of a fuel cell

 1. Hydrogen is fed here, it reacts with $\ce{ OH- }$ [[ions]] in solution. The reaction that occurs is $\ce{ 2H_{2}_{\text{(g)}} +4OH-_{\text{(aq)}} -> 4H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} +4e-}$
 2. Next, electrons produced in reaction 1 travel through a platinum electrode
 3. This is the component, the electrons are used to power something
 4. Oxygen is fed in here. It reacts with water and the 4 electrons made from step 1 to make $\ce{ OH- }$ ions, the reaction that occurs is $\ce{O_{2}_{\text{(g)}} +2H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} +4e- -> 4OH-_{\text{(aq)}} }$
 5. Electrons flow to the negative electrode (the cathode) which is made from platinum
 6. The electrolyte is made from a $\ce{ KOH }$ solution. It carries the $\ce{ OH- }$ ions from the cathode to the anode
 7. Electrons flow from the positive electrode (the anode) which is made from platinum
 8. The product of the reaction in step 1 is released into the surroundings and water is emitted
 9. $\ce{ OH- }$ ions produced from reaction 4 are carried towards the anode via the electrolyte
Combining the two [[half equations]] we get the following overall equation:
$$
\ce{ 2H_{2}_{\text{(g)}} +O_{2}_{\text{(g)}} -> 2H_{2}O_{\text{(g)}} }
$$

## Advantages of fuel cells
- Fuel cells are much more [[Efficiency|efficient]] than an [[Heat Engine|internal combustion engine]] as more energy is converted into [[Kinetic Energy]]. Combustion engines waste a lot of thermal energy
- Fuel cells don't need to be recharged, they just need a ready supply of oxygen and hydrogen
- The only waste product is water, and no carbon dioxide is emitted
## Disadvantages of fuel cells
- Hydrogen is highly flammable and must be stored and transported correctly
- It is expensive to store and transport hydrogen as it requires the use of pressurised containers
- Energy is required to make the hydrogen and oxygen in the first place. Fossil fuels are generally used to pass water through an electrolysis process, which contributes to carbon dioxide emissions
