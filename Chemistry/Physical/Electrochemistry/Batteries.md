Batteries are [[Electrochemical Cells]] that are connected in series to produce a larger [[Emf]]. They are either rechargeable or non-rechargeable. Batteries tend to have an electrolyte that acts as a conductive pathway for [[ions]] to move from one electrode to another 
## Non-Rechargeable Batteries
Non-rechargeable batteries tend to be cheaper than rechargeable batteries
## Rechargeable Batteries
Rechargeable batteries are reversible and can last longer, so are cheaper in the long term. [[Lithium Ion Battery|Lithium ion batteries]] are an example of a rechargeable battery, they are commonly used in wireless power tools, tablets, mobile phones and electric cars
