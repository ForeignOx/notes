Electrode potential is the [[Potential Difference]] that a given [[Electrochemical Cells|half cell]] can output
Standard electrode potential is denoted $E^{\theta}$, and the conditions for this are [[standard conditions]] but all ions in solution must also have a concentration of $1.00\pu{ moldm-3 }$ with no [[Electric Current|current]] flowing
The electrode potential of the cell is:
$$
E^{\theta}_\text{cell} = E_\text{reduced}-E_\text{oxidised}
$$
## Concentration affecting Electrode Potential
If the concentration of a reactant is increased, then by [[Le Chatelier's Principle]], the equilibrium will shift to produce more electron transfer, which will increase the electrode potential
## Temperature affecting Electrode Potential
Most cells are [[Exothermic Reactions|exothermic]], so increasing the temperature will decrease the electrode potential. If the electrode potential is positive, then the reaction is [[Spontaneous Reactions|feasible]]
