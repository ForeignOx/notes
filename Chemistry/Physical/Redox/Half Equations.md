Half equations show reduction and oxidation stages in 2 equations. All half equations must have electrons in
These are the steps required to balance a half equation:
1. Write down the species before and after a reaction
2. Balance any atoms apart from oxygen and hydrogen
3. Balance any oxygens with $\ce{ H_{2}O }$
4. Balance any hydrogens with $\ce{ H+ }$ [[ions]]
5. Balance charges with electrons $\ce{ e- }$

## Combining Half Equations
2 half equations can be combined to make a full ionic equation, simply by balancing electrons and cancelling terms on both sides
