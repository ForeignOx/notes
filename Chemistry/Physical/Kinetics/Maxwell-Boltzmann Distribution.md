The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution shows the energy in gas particles

Particles of gas in a sample move at different speeds, some move slowly, some move quickly and they all have different amounts of [[Kinetic Energy]], if we plot this on a graph, we can see that the energy is modelled by a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution
If we increase the temperature the graph changes like so:

This is due to particles having more [[Kinetic Energy]] on average
Two lines only intersect at one point, and the [[activation energy]] does not move, but there is a larger area of the graph past the line of activation energy, so more molecules will have enough energy to react. Note that the peak is lower and to the right, the area under the curve is constant
