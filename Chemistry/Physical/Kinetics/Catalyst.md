A substance that increases the rate of a reaction by providing an alternative reaction pathway which has a lower [[activation energy]]. The catalyst is chemically unchanged at the end of the reaction
As [[transition metals]] have variable [[oxidation states]] they are good catalysts by receiving and losing some electrons in the [[Electron Configuration|d-orbitals]] to speed up reactions
Catalysts are used to make proeduct faster and can be used to lower the tmperature required for a reaction. This saves [[energy]] and money and is better for the environment
## Types of Catalyst
Catalysts can be homogeneous or heterogeneous
### Heterogeneous
This is a catalyst that is in a different phase from the reactants. The catalyst is in a different state to the reactants. This is the case in the Haber process:
$$
\ce{ N_{2}_{\text{(g)}} +2H_{2}_{\text{(g)}} -> 2NH_{3}_{\text{(g)}} }
$$
A solid iron catalyst is used which is a different state to the gaseous reactants
Increasing the surface area of the heterogeneous catalyst will increase the rate of reaction. More particles can react with the catalyst at the same time
Heterogeneous catalysts can be poisoned by impurities. Impurities can bind to the surface of a catalyst and block the active sites for reactants to absorb. When an impurity blocks a site, we call this poisoning. Catalytic poisoning reduces the surface area of the catalyst for the reacatnts to add to. This slows down the reaction. An example is in the Haber process, the hydrogen is made from methane which can contain sulfur impurities. Any sulfur that is not removed will adsorb to the surface, forming Iron Sulfide. The catalyst is less efficient. A poisoned catalyst means:
- Less product is made
- The catalyst needs to be replaced or cleaned more often
- Increased cost of the chemical process
### Homogeneous
This is a catalyst that is in the same phase as the reactants. Generally, homogeneous catalysts are aqueous in aqueous reactants. For example, using sulphuric acid to make an ester
Homogeneous catalysts form intermediate species by reactants combining with the catalyst, which react to form products. The catalyst is reformed again
Homogeneous catalysts have a unique energy profile diagram:

The first bump is the formation of the intermediate, the second is the reformation of the catalyst. An example of this is the oxidation of iodide ions using peroxodisulfate. The reaction uncatalysed is very slow as we are trying to react two negatively charged ions together which repel. As a result, this reaction has a high activation energy:
$$
\ce{ S_{2}O_{8}^2-_{\text{(aq)}} +2I-_{\text{(aq)}} -> I_{2}_{\text{(aq)}} +2SO_{4}^2-_{\text{(aq)}} }
$$
If we use $\ce{ Fe^2+ }$ as a catalyst we can lower the activation energy and speed up the reaction. The first part is the reduction of peroxodisulfate:
$$
\ce{ S_{2}O_{8}^2-_{\text{(aq)}} +2Fe^2+_{\text{(aq)}} -> 2Fe^3+_{\text{(aq)}} +2SO_{4}^2-_{\text{(aq)}} }
$$
So $\ce{ Fe^2+ }$ is oxidised to $\ce{ Fe^3+ }$ and $\ce{ S_{2}O_{8}^2- }$ is reduced to $\ce{ SO_{4}^2- }$. Then the $\ce{ Fe^3+ }$ reacts with $\ce{ I- }$ ions to produce $\ce{ I_{2} }$, reforming $\ce{ Fe^2+ }$
$$
\ce{ 2I-_{\text{(aq)}} +2Fe^3+_{\text{(aq)}} -> 2Fe^2+_{\text{(aq)}} +I_{2}_{\text{(aq)}} }
$$
### Autocatalysis
Autocatalysis is another form of homogeneous catalysis where the product catalyses the reaction; it catalyses itself
An example of autocatalysis is where $\ce{ Mn^2+ }$ is the catalyst in a reaction between $\ce{ C_{2}O_{4}^2- }$ and $\ce{ MnO_{4}- }$. $\ce{ Mn^2+ }$ is a product and a catalyst. This means that as the reaction proceeds, the amount of product increases and so does the rate of reaction. The reaction uncatalysed is very slow. We are trying to react two negatively charged ions together, which repel. As a result, this reaction has a high activation energy:
$$
\ce{ 2MnO_{4}-_{\text{(aq)}} +16H+_{\text{(aq)}} +5C_{2}O_{4}^2-_{\text{(aq)}} -> 2Mn^2+_{\text{(aq)}} +8H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} +10CO_{2}_{\text{(g)}} }
$$
First, the $\ce{ Mn^2+ }$ catalyses the reaction converting $\ce{ MnO_{4}- }$ into $\ce{ Mn^3+ }$:
$$
\ce{ MnO_{4}-_{\text{(aq)}} +8H+_{\text{(aq)}} +4Mn^2+_{\text{(aq)}} -> 5Mn^3+_{\text{(aq)}} +4H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} }
$$
Then the $\ce{ Mn^3+ }$ formed reacts with $\ce{ C_{2}O_{4}^2- }$ and $\ce{ Mn^2+ }$ ions are reformed:
$$
\ce{ 2Mn^3+_{\text{(aq)}} +C_{2}O_{4}^2-_{\text{(aq)}} -> 2Mn^2+_{\text{(aq)}} +2CO_{2}_{\text{(g)}} }
$$
