Measuring [[rate of reaction]] can be done in a variety of ways:
### How long it takes for a precipitate to form
Place a cross on paper and time how long it takes for the cross to disappear (precipitate to form). One problem with this method is that it is difficult to know exactly when the cross disappears
### Amount of mass lost
For reactions that produce a gas, place a reaction on a balance and measure the mass loss as gas lost. This is a fairly accurate method, and you may need to use a fume cupboard if the gas is harmful or toxic
### Volume of gas produced#
For reactions that produce gas, measure the amount of gas produced using a gas syringe, then measure this over a specified time
### Change in pH of a reaction
The pH of a reaction may change over time if $\ce{ H+ }$ ions are used up or produced, a pH probe can be used to measure the pH of a reaction at regular intervals, you can then calculate the $\ce{ H+ }$ ion concentration
### Colour change
If a reaction has a colour change, then the rate can be measured using a colourimeter, which measures the absorbance of light , the more concentrated a sample is, the darker its colour. Note that colourimeters need calibration
