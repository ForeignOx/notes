[[Catalyst|Catalysts]] are generally used to speed up a specific reaction, increasing [[rate of reaction]]. Different catalysts are used for different reactions. They are used to make a product faster and can be used to lower the temperature required for a reaction, this saves energy and money
On a [[Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution]],  this means the line for activation energy moves to the left:

On an energy profile diagram, the height of the line of the reaction is decreased:
