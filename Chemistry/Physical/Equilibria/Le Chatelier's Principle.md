If a reaction at [[Dynamic Equilibrium|equilibrium]] is subjected to a change in pressure, temperature or concentration, the position of equilibrium will move to counteract the change
Note this only occurs in [[homogeneous equilibria]]
## Concentration
If we increase the concentration of a reactant or product, the equilibrium will shift to try to reduce the concentration, if a concentration is decreased, the opposite will happen
## Pressure
If we increase the pressure, the equilibrium will shift to try to reduce the pressure (the opposite will happen if the pressure is decreased). If we increase the pressure equilibrium will shift to the side with the fewest number of gas particles, reducing the pressure
## Temperature
If we increase the temperature, the equilibrium will shift to try to reduce the temperature (The opposite will happen if the temperature is decreased). If we increase the temperature, equilibrium will shift in the [[Endothermic Reactions|endothermic]] direction as this will reduce the temperature. If the forward reaction is [[Exothermic Reactions|exothermic]], $\Delta H$ is negative
## Catalysts
[[Catalyst|Catalysts]] have no effect on the position of equilibrium. A catalyst will speed up the [[Rate of reaction|rate]] of the forward and backward reaction equally, so it will speed up the rate at which equilibrium is reached, but have no effect on yield
