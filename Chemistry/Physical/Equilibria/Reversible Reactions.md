Reversible reactions are reactions that can go forward and backwards, they are represented with $\ce{ <=> }$
### Forward Reaction
Initially reactants are used up quickly, but then then slow as their concentration drops
### Backward Reaction
Initially reactants are reformed slowly, but then speed up as the concentration of products increases
