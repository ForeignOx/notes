$K_\text{C}$ is the [[Dynamic Equilibrium|equilibrium]] constant that can be worked out from the molar concentration for a given reaction
For a general reaction:
$$
\ce{ \alpha A +\beta B <=> \gamma C + \delta D}
$$
$$
K_\text{C}=\frac{[C]^{\gamma}[D]^{\delta}}{[A]^{\alpha}[B]^{\beta}}
$$
Where $[A]$ is the concentration of $A$ in $\pu{ mol dm-3 }$ 
## Temperature affecting $K_{\text{C}}$
$K_\text{C}$ is only valid for one temperature, as changing the temperature will change equilibrium concentrations, which will change $K_\text{C}$. If temperature change causes equilibrium to shift right, $K_\text{C}$ will increase, and the converse is true. You can work out the way that equilibrium is shifted using [[Le Chatelier's Principle]]
## Concentration affecting $K_\text{C}$
The value of $K_\text{C}$ is unaffected by any changes in concentration
## [[Catalyst|Catalysts]] affecting $K_\text{C}$
Adding a catalyst has no effect on the value of $K_\text{C}$ as catalysts speed up the [[Rate of reaction|rate]] of forward and backward reaction
