The equation of the reaction to make ethanol is:
$$
\ce{ C_{2}H_{4}_{(g)} +H_{2}0_{(g)} <=> C_{2}H_{5}OH_{(g)} }\,\,\,\,\,\,\Delta H=\pu{ -46kJmol-1 } 
$$
This reaction occurs at a pressure of 60atm, a temperature of 573K with a phosphoric acid ($\ce{ H_{3}PO_{4} }$) [[catalyst]]
## Pressure
High pressure means [[Dynamic Equilibrium|equilibrium]] shifts right, producing more ethanol. Fewer moles of gas on the right, so equilibrium shifts to the right due to [[Le Chatelier's Principle]] to reduce the pressure, high pressure increases [[Pressure Affects Rate|rate]] too, however high pressure environments are expensive since thicker more robust vessels and pipes are needed, so there is a compromise between yield, speed and cost
## Temperature
Forward reaction is [[Exothermic Reactions|exothermic]], so decreasing the temperature will mean equilibrium shifts to the right, producing more ethanol due to [[Le Chatelier's Principle]]. However, a lower temperature means a lower [[Temperature Affects Rate|rate]] of reaction. 573K is a compromise between yield and rate
