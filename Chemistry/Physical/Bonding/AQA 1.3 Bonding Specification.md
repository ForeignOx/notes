The physical and chemical properties of compounds depend on the ways in which the compounds are held together by chemical bonds and by intermolecular forces. Theories of bonding explain how atoms or ions are held together in these structures. Materials scientists use knowledge of structure and bonding to engineer new materials with desirable properties. These new materials may offer new applications in a range of different modern technologies.

| Bonding pairs and lone (non-bonding) pairs of electrons as charge clouds that repel each other.<br><br>Pairs of electrons in the outer shell of atoms arrange themselves as far apart as possible to minimise repulsion.<br><br>Lone pair–lone pair repulsion is greater than lone pair–bond pair repulsion, which is greater than bond pair–bond pair repulsion.<br><br>[[Shapes of Molecules\|The effect of electron pair repulsion on bond angles.]]<br><br>**Students should be able to:**<br><br>- explain the shapes of, and bond angles in, simple molecules and ions with up to six electron pairs (including lone pairs of electrons) surrounding the central atom. | **MS 0.3 and 4.1**<br><br>Students could be given familiar and unfamiliar examples of species and asked to deduce the shape according to valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) principles. |

| --- | --- |
| [[Electronegativity]] as the power of an atom to attract the pair of electrons in a covalent bond.<br><br>The electron distribution in a covalent bond between elements with different electronegativities will be unsymmetrical. This produces a [[Polar Bonds\|polar covalent bond]], and may cause a molecule to have a permanent dipole.<br><br>**Students should be able to:**<br><br>- use partial charges to show that a bond is polar<br>- explain why some molecules with polar bonds do not have a permanent dipole. |  |
