Electronegativity is the ability for an atom to attract electrons towards itself in a [[covalent bond]]
The further up and to the right you go on the periodic table (excluding noble gases), the more electronegative an element is. Fluorine is the most electronegative element
The Pauling Scale helps us to quantify how electronegative an element is, the larger the number, the higher the electronegativity
## Factors affecting electronegativity
### Nuclear Charge
More protons means stronger attraction between nucleus and bonding a pair of electrons
### Atomic radius
Closer to the nucleus stronger attraction between nucleus and bonding a pair of electrons
### Shielding
Fewer shells of electrons between the nucleus
## Across a Period
Electronegativity increases as atomic radius decreases, so more nuclear charge
## Down a Group
