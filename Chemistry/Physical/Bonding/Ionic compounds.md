Ionic compounds have a giant ionic structure with properties such as:
- Regular structure
- Cubic shape
- Giant repeating pattern

Most ionic compounds dissolve in water as water molecules are polar, so they can attract the positive and negative [[Ions]] and break up the structure. 
Ionic compounds conduct electricity when molten or dissolved in solution as the ions are free to move around
Ionic compounds have very high melting points as there are many, strong electrostatic forces between oppositely charged ions. Lots of energy is needed to overcome these forces
