Hydrogen bonding is the strongest [[intermolecular forces|intermolecular force]] and occurs when molecules have very electronegative elements, such as $\ce{ N, O or F }$ which have lone pairs which bond with hydrogen
Ice forms a regular structure held by hydrogen bonding. The molecules are further apart than in a liquid, making ice less dense than water
