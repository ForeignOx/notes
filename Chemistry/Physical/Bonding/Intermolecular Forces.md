There are three main types of intermolecular force, the weakest being [[Van der Waals Forces]], then [[Dipole-Dipole Forces]]. and finally the strongest are [[Hydrogen Bonds]]. Usually, when boiling a liquid, we break the intermolecular forces rather than covalent or ionic bonds, this is when the molecules have enough energy to overcome these forces.
