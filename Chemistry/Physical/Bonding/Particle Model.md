The particle model is a way of explaining properties of solids, liquids and gases by suggesting that all matter is made of particles
### Solids
Particles are tightly packed and in a regular arrangement which is why they have a high density
Particles vibrate on the spot and can't be compressed
### Liquids
Particles are tightly packed and in a random arrangement which is why they have a high density
Particles move freely and it is very difficult for liquids to be compressed
Particles in a liquid have more energy than in a solid
### Gases
Particles are spaced out and in a random arrangement which is why they have a low density
Particles move freely and it is relatively easy for liquids to be compressed
Particles in a gas tend to have more energy than in solids and liquids
