## Graphite
![[Pasted image 20240205132713.png]]
Properties:
- Layers slide easily as there are [[Van der Waals Forces|weak forces]] between layers
- The many strong [[Covalent bond|covalent bonds]] in graphite mean that it has a very high melting point
- Each carbon is bonded with three others, meaning each has a 4th delocalised electron
- The delocalised electrons between the layers allow graphite to conduct electricity as they can carry a charge
- Layers are far apart in comparison to covalent bond length, meaning that graphite has a low density
- Graphite is insoluble, the covalent bonds are too strong to break
## Diamond

Properties:
- The tightly packed, rigid arrangement allows heat to conduct well in diamond
- Unlike graphite, diamond can be cut to make gemstones
- Each carbon is bonded 4 times in a tetrahedral configuration
- Diamond has a very high melting point due to may strong covalent bonds
- Diamond is very hard
- Diamond doesn't conduct electricity as it doesn't have any delocalised electrons
- Diamond is insoluble, the covalent bonds are too strong to break
