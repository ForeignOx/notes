One should be familiar with these:

| Type of Bonding | Example | Usual state at room temp and pressure | Conduct electricity as a solid? | Conduct electricity as a liquid? | Soluble in water? | Melting and Boiling point |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Giant Covalent (Macromolecular) | Graphite, Diamond, $\ce{ SiO_{2} }$ | Solid | No (except graphite) | No (difficult to melt, normally sublime) | No | High - have to break strong covalent bonds |
| Simple Molecular (simple covalent) | $\ce{ I_{2}, NH_{3}, H_{2}O }$ | Liquid or Gas (except Iodine which is solid) | No | No | Depends on polarity of molecule | Low - have to break intermolecular foces |
| Giant Ionic | $\ce{ NaCl, CaO, MgBr_{2} }$ | Solid | No | Yes (free ions allow electrical conduction) | Yes | High - have to break strong electrostatic forces |
| Metallic | $\ce{ Mg, Na, Cu }$ | Solid | Yes | Yes | No | High - have to break strong electrostatic forces |
