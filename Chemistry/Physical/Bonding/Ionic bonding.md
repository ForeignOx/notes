Ionic compounds are oppositely charged [[ions]] held together by electrostatic attractions. To gain a full shell of electrons, an atom with very few electrons in its outer shell will donate electrons to an atom with nearly all electrons in its outer shell causing both to have full outer shells, forming oppositely charged ions that attract to each other
