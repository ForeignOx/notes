Metals undergo [[metallic bonding]]
The more electrons an atom can donate to the delocalised system, the higher the melting point
Metals are good thermal conductors as the delocalised electrons can transfer [[Kinetic Energy]]
Metals are good electrical conductors as the delocalised electrons are mobile and can carry a current
Metals have high melting points due to strong electrostatic attractions
Metals are [[ductile]]
Metals are [[malleable]]
Metals tend to by shiny
Metals are sonorous
