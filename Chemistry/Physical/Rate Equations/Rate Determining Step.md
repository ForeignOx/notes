The [[Rate of reaction|rate]] determining step is the slowest step in a multi-step reaction. Reactants that appear in the [[rate equation]] must appear in the rate determining step, note that [[Catalyst|catalysts]] can appear in the rate equation too
If the reactant in the rate determining step is an intermediate, i.e. it is formed from other reactants, they also need to be included in the rate equation
If given a rate equation and a set of reactions, the rate determining step will be the first reaction which will have involved all the reactants in the rate equation
