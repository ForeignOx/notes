The rate equation links [[Rate of reaction|rate]] with concentrations of reactants, for a reaction:
$$
aA+bB\to C+D
$$
$$
\text{Rate} = k[A]^{a}[B]^{b}
$$
where $a$ and $b$ are the orders of $A$ and $B$ respectively, $k$ is the rate constant, which is fixed for a given temperature, if the temperature increases, $k$ increases
### Zero order
If the order of a substance is 0, then changes in concentration have no effect on rate
### 1st order
If the order of a substance is 1, then changes in concentration are proportional to rate:
$$
[A]\propto \text{Rate}
$$
### 2nd order
If the order of a substance is 2, then changes in concentration squared are proportional to rate:
$$
[A]^{2}\propto \text{Rate}
$$
Orders can only be determined experimentally
