A reaction where you can time how long it takes for a colour change to occur:
$$
\ce{ H_{2}O_{2}_{(aq)} +2H+_{(aq)} ->2H_{2}O_{(l)} +I_{2}_{(aq)}}
$$
We can add sodium thiosulfate and starch to the reaction mixture, the sodium thiosulfate reacts with the $\ce{ I_{2} }$ that is produced, when there is no sodium thiosulfate left, the $\ce{ I_{2} }$ reacts with the starch, giving a deep blue/black colour. Reactions like iodine clock can be monitored by sitting the reaction vessel on some paper with a cross on. We time how long it takes until we can't see the cross through the beaker, Varying the concentration of iodine or hydrogen peroxide and keeping everything else constant will result in the time taken to change, allowing us to work out the [[Rate Equation|order of the reaction]]
