The Arrhenius equation links [[activation energy]] and temperature to the [[Rate Equation|rate constant]]:
$$
k=Ae^{ -E_{a}/RT }
$$

Where $k$ is the rate constant, $A$ is the Arrhenius constant, $E_{a}$ is the activation energy in $\pu{ Jmol-1}$, $R$ is the gas constant which is equal to $8.31\pu{ JK-1mol-1 }$ 

We can see that as the activation energy gets smaller, the larger the rate constant gets. This is because the as the activation energy decreases, the [[rate of reaction]] increases as more particles have enough energy to collide
As temperature increases, the rate constant increases, this is because of how [[temperature affects rate]]
