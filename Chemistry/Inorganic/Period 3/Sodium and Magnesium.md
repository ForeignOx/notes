Sodium (Group 1) is more reactive than Magnesium ([[Group 2]]). When they react, they lose electrons to form $\ce{ Na+ }$ and $\ce{ Mg^2+ }$ respectively. Sodium is more reactive than magnesium as the amount of [[energy]] required to remove an electron is lower than it is to remove 2 from magnesium, hence more energy is needed for magnesium to react
## Sodium Reacting with Water
Sodium reacts vigorously with cold water, forming a ball and fizzing. The gas produced is hydrogen gas and an alkaline solution of sodium hydroxide is formed. The reaction is:
$$
\ce{ 2Na_{\text{(s)}} +2H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} -> 2NaOH_{\text{(aq)}} + H_{2}_{\text{(g)}}}
$$
## Magnesium Reacting with Water
Magnesium reacts slowly with cold water forming a weak alkaline solution of magnesium hydroxide. This is a weak alkaline solution as the magnesium hydroxide is sparingly soluble, so there are few $\ce{ OH- }$ [[ions]] in solution. The reaction is:
$$
\ce{ Mg_{\text{(s)}} + 2H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} -> Mg(OH)2_{\text{(aq)}} +H_{2}_{\text{(g)}} }
$$
Magnesium reacts much faster with steam, forming magnesium oxide instead. The reaction is:
$$
\ce{ Mg_{\text{(s)}} + H_{2}O_{\text{(g)}} -> MgO_{\text{(s)}} + H_{2}_{\text{(g)}}}
$$
