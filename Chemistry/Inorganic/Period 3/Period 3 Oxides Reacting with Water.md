# Ionic Oxides
[[Ionic compounds|Ionic]] oxides of [[Sodium and Magnesium]] both form alkaline solutions when added to water. Ionic oxides contain the $\ce{ O^2- }$ ion which accepts protons from the water molecules when dissolved in solution
## $\ce{ Na_{2}O }$ Reacting with Water
$$
\ce{ Na_{2}O_{\text{(s)}} +H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} -> 2NaOH_{\text{(aq)}} }
$$
Sodium oxide dissolves in water to form an alkaline solution of [[pH]] 12-14. It dissolves readily
## $\ce{ MgO }$ Reacting with Water
$$
\ce{ MgO_{\text{(s)}} +H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} -> Mg(OH)2_{\text{(aq)}} }
$$
Magnesium oxide dissolves sparingly in water, so the alkaline solution is not as strong and has a pH of 9-10
# Simple Covalent Oxides
Simple [[Covalent bond|covalent]] oxides of Phosphorus and Sulfur form [[Brønsted–Lowry Acids|acidic]] solutions when added to water. The acids formed dissociate in solution forming $\ce{ H+ }$ [[Ions]] and negative ions (conjugate [[Brønsted–Lowry Bases|bases]]). The solutions made tend to have a pH of 0-2 (assuming a minimum concentration of $1\pu{ moldm-3 }$)
## $\ce{P_{4}O_{10}  }$ Oxide Reacting with Water
$$
\ce{ P_{4}O_{10}_{\text{(s)}} +6H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} -> 4H_{3}PO_{4}_{\text{(aq)}} }
$$
$\ce{ H_{3}PO_{4} }$ is phosphoric (V) acid
## $\ce{SO_{2}  }$ Reacting with Water
$$
\ce{ SO_{2}_{\text{(g)}} +H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} -> H_{2}SO_{3}_{\text{(aq)}} }
$$
$\ce{ H_{2}SO_{3} }$ is sulfuric (IV) acid
## $\ce{ SO_{3} }$ Reacting with Water
$$
\ce{ SO_{3}_{\text{(l)}} + H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} -> H_{2}SO_{4}_{\text{(aq)}} }
$$
$\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} }$ is sulfuric (VI) acid
# Silicon and Aluminium Oxides
Silicon and Aluminium oxides behave differently when added to water.
## $\ce{ SiO_{2} }$ 'Reacting' with Water
Silicon dioxide forms a [[Giant Covalent Structures|giant covalent structure]] which has many, strong, covalent bonds that require large amounts of [[Energy]] to break. For this reason, silicon dioxide is insoluble in water. It will react with a base to form a salt, so it is classed as an acid
## $\ce{ Al_{2}O_{3} }$ 'Reacting' with Water
Aluminium oxide is [[Amphoteric Substances|amphoteric]]. It has both [[Covalent Character|covalent]] and ionic character and is insoluble in water. It will however react with both acids and bases to form salts which is why it is amphoteric
