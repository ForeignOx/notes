To see if a compound contains sulfate [[ions]], you can perform the following test:
1. Add hydrochloric acid to remove any carbonates as these could precipitate out after adding barium chloride, which would give a false result
2. Add barium chloride, a white precipitate will form if there are sulfates. The white precipitate is barium sulfate, which is insoluble
