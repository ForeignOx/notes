Barium sulfate is also known as a barium meal. Barium sulfate is used to help identify problems with the digestive tract. A patient drinks a suspension of barium sulfate. This coats the lining of soft tissues such as the stomach. The patient then undergoes an x-ray. X-rays are absorbed by barium sulfate. Normally, soft tissues won't show up as the x-rays go straight through
Barium compounds are toxic, however, because barium sulfate is insoluble, it can't be absorbed into the blood
