Group 2 elements form 2+ [[ions]] when they react. All group 2 metals have [[Electron Configuration|electron configurations]] that end in $s^{2}$
## Atomic Radius
The [[atomic size|atomic radius]] of group 2 elements increases as you go down the group

## Ionisation Energy
First [[Enthalpy Change of nth Ionisation|ionisation energy]] decreases as you go down the group. This is because extra shells are added and there is more [[Electron Shielding|shielding]] hence weaker attraction between the nucleus and outer electrons. The outer electrons are also further from the nucleus which weakens the attraction. Both of these factors make it easier to remove the outer electron and so less [[Energy]] is required to remove the outer electron. Note that there is an increase in the number of protons as you go down the group, however the effect of shielding overrides an increase in positive charge

## Melting Points
Melting points generally decrease as you go down the group. Group 2 elements form [[Metallic Bonding|metallic]] structures with positive ions and a sea of delocalised electrons. As you go down the group, the size of the metal ion increases, but the number of delocalised electrons remains the same. The charge also remains the same. Larger ions means that there is a greater distance between the positive nuclei in metal ions and delocalised electrons, which weakens the attractive force. This makes it easier to break bonds and hence less energy is required. This leads to lower melting points

Magnesium is an exception due to structural difference compared to other group 2 metals
## Reaction with Water
Group 2 elements react with water to from [[Brønsted–Lowry Bases|bases]]. For a general group two element $\ce{ M }$, the general reaction with water is:
$$
\ce{ M_{\text{(s)}} + 2H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} ->M(OH)2_{\text{(aq)}} + H_{2}_{\text{(g)}} }
$$
Reactivity increases down the group (Beryllium doesn't react). This is because atoms get larger and so the outer electrons are further from the nucleus, so it is easier to remove them and hence the elements are more reactive. There is also more shielding as you go down the group, which also increases this affect
The exception again is magnesium, which reacts slowly with cold water but more vigorously with steam, which produces magnesium oxide ($\ce{ MgO }$) instead of magnesium hydroxide
## Solubility
### Solubility of sulfates
Solubility of sulfates decreases as you go down the group, so magnesium sulfate is very soluble, but barium sulfate is sparingly soluble
### Solubility of hydroxides
Solubility of hydroxides increases as you go down the group, so magnesium hydroxide is sparingly soluble, while barium hydroxide is very soluble
## Neutralisation
Group 2 compounds can be used to neutralise [[Brønsted–Lowry Acids|acids]]
### Acidic Soils
Calcium hydroxide ($\ce{ Ca(OH)2}$), aka slaked lime,  is used to neutralise acidic soils
### Antacids
Magnesium hydroxide ($\ce{ Mg(OH)2 }$) is used to neutralise excess stomach acid
