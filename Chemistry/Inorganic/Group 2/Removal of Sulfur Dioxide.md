Sulfur Dioxide emissions can be reduced using calcium carbonate or calcium oxide
Electricity can be produced by burning fossil fuels like coal. This produces sulfur dioxide gas, which is a pollutant
A process called [[wet scrubbing]] is a method whereby an alkali is used to neutralise sulfur dioxide in flue gases. The product of this reaction is calcium sulfite, which can be used in the production of plasterboard. The reactions for this process with calcium carbonate and calcium oxide respectively are:
$$
\ce{ CaCO_{3}_{\text{(s)}} +SO_{2}_{\text{(g)}}-> CaSO_{3}_{\text{(s)}}  +CO_{2}_{\text{(g)}} }
$$
$$
\ce{ CaO_{\text{(s)}} +SO_{2}_{\text{(g)}} \to CaSO_{3}_{\text{(s)}} }
$$
