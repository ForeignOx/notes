Group 2 [[Ions]] in a solid sample can be tested using flame tests. They can be made into solutions and sprayed on the bunsen burner too, however this may be difficult if the sample being tested is insoluble
1. Dip a nichrome wire in concentrated hydrochloric acid
2. Dip into sample
3. Place the loop into the blue bunsen flame and observe the colour
Different ions will give different colours:
- Calcium ions, $\ce{ Ca^2+ }$ will give a <span style="color:#c00000">dark red</span> colour
- Strontium ions, $\ce{ Sr^2+ }$ will give a <span style="color:#ff0000">red</span> colour
- Barium ions, $\ce{ Ba^2+ }$ will give a <span style="color:#00b050">green</span> colour
