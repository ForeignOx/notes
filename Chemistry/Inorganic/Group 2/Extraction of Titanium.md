Titanium can be extracted from its ore, using magnesium with these steps
1. Titanium ore ($\ce{ TiO_{2} }$) is converted to titanium(IV)chloride ($\ce{ TiCl_{4} }$) by heating with carbon and chlorine gas
2. Then the $\ce{ TiCl_{4} }$ is passed through a fractional distillation column to increase purity
3. The purified $\ce{ TiCl_{4} }$ is then reduced using magnesium in a $1000^{\circ}\pu{ C}$ furnace, this reaction has the equation:
$$
\ce{ TiCl_{4} +2Mg -> Ti + 2MgCl_{2} }
$$

Titanium is useful as it is a very lightweight metal
