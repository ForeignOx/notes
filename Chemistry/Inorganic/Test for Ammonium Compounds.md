You can test for ammonium compounds by adding sodium hydroxide ($\ce{ NaOH }$), and gently heating. If ammonium compounds are present, ammonia gas will be produced:
$$
\ce{ NH_{4}+_{\text{(aq)}} + OH-_{\text{(aq)}} -> NH_{3}_{\text{(g)}} +H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}}}
$$
Then hove a damp piece of litmus paper over the reaction. Ammonia will dissolve in the water and turn the litmus paper blue
