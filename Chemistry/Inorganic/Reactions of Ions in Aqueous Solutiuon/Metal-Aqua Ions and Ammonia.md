Adding ammonia to [[Hydrated (metal-aqua) Complexes|metal-aqua]] [[ions]] forms metal hydroxide precipitates. Sometimes, adding excess ammonia leads to [[ligands|ligand]] exchange reactions
When in solution, ammonia exists in the following [[Dynamic Equilibrium|equilibrium]]:
$$
\ce{ NH_{3}_{\text{(aq)}} +H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} <=> NH_{4}+_{\text{(aq)}} +OH-_{\text{(aq)}} }
$$
As this reaction produces $\ce{ OH- }$ ions, adding small quantities of $\ce{ NH_{3} }$ to the metal-aqua ion produces the same metal hydroxides as what you would get [[Hydrolysis of Metal-Aqua Complexes|adding a base]] ($\ce{ OH- }$ ions)
With some metal hydroxides, when we add excess ammonia solution, we get partial ligand substitution. An example is with $\ce{ Cu(OH)2(H_{2}O)4 }$, when excess ammonia is added, some ligands are displaced and a charged, soluble complex is formed
$$
\ce{ Cu(OH)2(H_{2}O)4_{\text{(aq)}} +4NH_{3} <=> [Cu(NH_{3})4(H_{2}O)2]^2+_{\text{(aq)}} +2OH-_{\text{(aq)}} +2H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} }
$$
