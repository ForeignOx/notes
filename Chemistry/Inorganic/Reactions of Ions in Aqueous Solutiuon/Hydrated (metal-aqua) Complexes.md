Metal-aqua complexes are formed when we add a [[Transition Metals|transition metal]] compound to water. Generally, $6$ water molecules form [[Covalent bond|coordinate bonds]] with the metal [[Ions|ion]]. A lone pair on the oxygen allows this bond to be formed

These complexes are also written as $\ce{ [M(H_{2}O)6]^2+_{\text{(aq)}} }$ and $\ce{ [M(H_{2}O)6]^3+_{\text{(aq)}} }$
