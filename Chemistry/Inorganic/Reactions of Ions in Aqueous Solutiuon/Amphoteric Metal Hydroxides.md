Metal hydroxides can act as an [[Brønsted–Lowry Acids|acid]] or [[Brønsted–Lowry Bases|base]] which means they are [[Amphoteric Substances|amphoteric]]. As we have seen, we can hydrolyse [[Hydrated (metal-aqua) Complexes|metal-aqua]] ions to form insoluble metal hydroxides by adding a base. Some metal hydroxides are amphoteric so they will dissolve in both excess and with a base. However, we can reverse this by simply adding an acid ($\ce{ H+ }$ ions) to the metal hydroxide precipitate and it will dissolve. They do this by accepting a $\ce{ H+ }$ ion and are a Brønsted–Lowry base
Aluminium hydroxide ($\ce{ Al(H_{2}O)_{3}(OH)3_{\text{(s)}} }$) is amphoteric. When we add a base it acts as a Brønsted–Lowry acid and donates $\ce{ H+ }$ ions to react with the $\ce{ OH- }$ and it dissolves. When we add an acid, it acts as Brønsted–Lowry base by accepting $\ce{ H+ }$ ions to form $\ce{ H_{3}O+ }$ in solution, and it dissolves
