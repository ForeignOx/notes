[[Hydrated (metal-aqua) Complexes|Metal-aqua ions]] are [[Brønsted–Lowry Acids|acidic]] when in solution. The charge of the ion has an effect on how acidic it is
$$
\ce{ [M(H_{2}O)6]^2+_{\text{(aq)}} +H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} <=> [M(H_{2}O)5(OH)]+_{\text{(aq)}} +H_{3}O+_{\text{(aq)}} }
$$
In this example a $2^+$ complex ion react with water. $\ce{ H_{3}O+ }$ which makes a solution acidic. This reaction is hydrolysis. $2^+$ ions dissociate weakly, so they are not very acidic
$$
\ce{ [M(H_{2}O)6]^3+_{\text{(aq)}} +H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} <=> [M(H_{2}O)5(OH)]^2+_{\text{(aq)}} +H_{3}O+_{\text{(aq)}} }
$$
In this example we have a $3^+$ metal_aqua complex ion. They dissciate more readily than $2^+$ complexes and are more acidic. This is because they have a higher charge density than $2^+$ ions. This is because they have a large charge and are the same size. As a result, the $3^+$ ions are more polarising than $2^+$ ions. They attract electrons in the $\ce{ O-H }$ bond in the water ligands more strongly, this weakens the bond. This means that it is more likely that the $\ce{ H+ }$ ion will be released. This means $3^+$ metal ions form more acidic solutions
We can hydrolyse further using $\ce{ OH- }$ ions to make insuluble metal hydroxides. When we hydrolyse $3^+$ metal aqua ions, an [[Dynamic Equilibrium|equilibrium]] is established. If we add $\ce{ OH- }$ ions, they remove $\ce{ H_{3}O+ }$ and by [[Le Chatelier's Principle]], they shift right
$$
\ce{ [M(H_{2}O)6]^3+_{\text{(aq)}} +H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} <=> [M(H_{2}O)5(OH)]^2+_{\text{(aq)}} +H_{3}O+_{\text{(aq)}} }
$$
$$
\downarrow
$$
$$
\ce{ [M(H_{2}O)5(OH)]^2+_{\text{(aq)}} +H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} <=> [M(H_{2}O)4(OH)2]+_{\text{(aq)}} +H_{3}O+_{\text{(aq)}} }
$$
$$
\downarrow
$$
$$
\ce{ [M(H_{2}O)4(OH)2]+_{\text{(aq)}} +H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} <=> M(H_{2}O)3(OH)3_{\text{(s)}} +H_{3}O+_{\text{(aq)}} }
$$
Finally further hydrolysis leads to the formation of a neutral complex that is solid and forms a precipitate in solution. The same happens to the $2^+$ ions, but there are only 2 steps. There are only two ligands that need to be deprotonated to form a neutral complex
$$
\ce{ [M(H_{2}O)6]^2+_{\text{(aq)}} +H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} <=> [M(H_{2}O)5(OH)]+_{\text{(aq)}} +H_{3}O+_{\text{(aq)}} }
$$
$$
\downarrow
$$
$$
\ce{ [M(H_{2}O)5(OH)]+_{\text{(aq)}} +H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} <=> M(H_{2}O)4(OH)2_{\text{(s)}} +H_{3}O+_{\text{(aq)}} }
$$
