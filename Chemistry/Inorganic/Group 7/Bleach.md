Bleach is made via a [[Disproportionation Reactions|disproportionation reaction]] mixing chlorine and sodium hydroxide to form sodium chlorate(I) solution - also known as bleach:
$$
\ce{ 2NaOH_{\text{(aq)}} +Cl_{2}_{\text{(g)}} -> NaClO_{\text{(aq)}} +NaCl_{\text{(aq)}} + H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} }
$$
Chlorine has an [[Oxidation States|oxidation state]] of 0 in $\ce{ Cl_{2} }$, it has an oxidation state of +1 in $\ce{ NaClO }$ and an oxidation state of -1 in $\ce{ NaCl }$, so it has been simultaneously been [[Redox|oxidised and reduced]]
