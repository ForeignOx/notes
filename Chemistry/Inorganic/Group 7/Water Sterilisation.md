Adding chlorine to water will produce chlorate(I) ions ($\ce{ClO- }$) which kill bacteria. This is used for making drinking water and pools safer
$$
\ce{ H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} +Cl_{2}_{\text{(g)}} -> 2H+_{\text{(aq)}} +Cl- _{\text{(aq)}} + ClO-_{\text{(aq)}} }
$$
Chlorine has simultaneously been [[Redox|reduced and oxidiesed]], so it has undergone a [[Disproportionation Reactions|disproportionation reaction]]
Sunlight can decompose chlorinated water too, however no $\ce{ ClO- }$ is made:
$$
\ce{ 2H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} + Cl_{2}_{\text{(g)}} -> 4H+_{\text{(aq)}} +2Cl-_{\text{(aq)}} +O_{2}_{\text{(g)}} }
$$
## Drinking water
There are advantages and disadvantages of chlorinating drinking water:
### Advantages
- Destroys microorganisms that cause disease
- Long lasting so reduces bacteria build up further down the supply
- Reduces growth of algae that discolours water and can give it a bad smell and taste
- Prevents cholera epidemics
### Disadvantages
- Chlorine gas is toxic and irritates the respiratory system
- Liquid chlorine causes severe chemical burns to the skin
- Chlorine can react with organic compounds present in the water to make chloroalkanes. These have been linked with causing cancer
