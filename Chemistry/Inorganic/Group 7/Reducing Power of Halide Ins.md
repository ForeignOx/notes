[[Halogens|Halide]] [[Ions]] lose an electron in reactions, so they are [[Reducing Agents]]. As we go down the group, the ionic radius increases so the distance between the nucleus and outer electrons becomes larger and there is more [[Electron Shielding|shielding]]. The attractive force gets weaker, hence the outer electron is lost more readily and this is the reason why $\ce{ I- }$ is a more powerful reducing agent than $\ce{ F- }$. Useful reactions to know are [[Halide Ions with Sulfuric Acid]] and [[Testing for Halide Ions with Silver Nitrate]]
