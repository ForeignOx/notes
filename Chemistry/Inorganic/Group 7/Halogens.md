The halogens make up the group 7 of the [[Periodic Table]] and these are some of them:
- Fluorine, $\ce{ F_{2} }$ which is a pale yellow gas
- Chlorine, $\ce{ Cl_{2} }$ which is a pale green gas
- Bromine, $\ce{ Br_{2} }$ which is a brown-orange liquid
- Iodine, $\ce{ I_{2} }$ which is a grey solid
As you go down the group, the boiling points increase. This is because the [[Van der Waals Forces]] increase due to the increasing size and relative mass of the atoms. The physical state goes from gas at the top (Fluorine) to solid at the bottom
As you go down the group, [[Electronegativity]] decreases as the [[Atomic Size|atoms get larger]] and the distance between the positive nucleus and the bonding electrons increases. There is also more [[Electron Shielding|shielding]]. This means that reactivity decreases down the group
Halogens are less [[Redox|oxidising]] as you go down the group, this can be shown in [[Halogen Displacement Reactions]]
