Some [[Halogens|halide]] [[ions]] can reduce concentrated sulfuric acid
### First reaction
Chloride, bromide and iodide ions will all do the first reaction:
$$
\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} +NaX -> NaHSO_{4} +HX }
$$
where $\ce{ X }$ is the halide ion. Note that $\ce{ HCl }$ produced will emit white misty fumes
### Second reaction
Bromide and iodide ions will perform a second reaction, this starts by turning the halide ions into halogens ([[redox|oxidising them]]) and then reacting them with sulfuric acid to reduce the sulfur
$$
\ce{ 2X- -> X_{2} + 2e-}
$$
$$
\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} +2H+ +2e- -> SO_{2} + 2H_{2}O }
$$
So the overall equation is:
$$
\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} +2H+ +2X- -> X_{2} +SO_{2} +2H_{2}O }
$$
Where $\ce{ X }$ is the halide ion. Note that with the bromide ions, orange vapour of $\ce{ Br_{2} }$ is produced

### Third reaction
Iodide ions will continue to react, reducing sulfur even more:
$$
\ce{ 6I- -> 3I_{2} +6e- }
$$
$$
\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} 6H+ +6e- -> S + 4H_{2}O }
$$
So the overall reaction is:
$$
\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} +6H+ +6I- -> 3I_{2} + S + 4H_{2}O }
$$
Note that yellow solid of $\ce{ S }$ is produced
### Fourth reaction
Iodide ions will continue to react, reducing sulfur even more
$$
\ce{ 8I- \to 4I_{2} +8e- }
$$
$$
\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} + 8H+ + 8e- -> H_{2}S +4H_{2}O }
$$
So the overall reaction is:
$$
\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} + 8H+ + 8I- -> 4I_{2} + H_{2}S +4H_{2}O }
$$
Note that rotten egg smell of $\ce{ H_{2}S }$ is produced
