Haemoglobin is a protein used to transport oxygen around the blood

The iron in haemoglobin is attached to the 4 nitrogens that forms the multidentate [[Ligands|ligand]] haem. One of the [[Dative Covalent bond|coordinate bonds]] (not shown) forms a large protein called globin. The final coordinate bond comes from either an oxygen or a water molecule. The [[Shapes of Molecules|structure is octahedral]] 
Oxygen substitutes the water ligand in the lungs where oxygen concentration is high to form oxyhaemoglobin. This is transported around the body. Oxyhaemoglobin gives up oxygen to a place where it is needed. Water takes the place and haemoglobin returns back to the lungs to start the process again
