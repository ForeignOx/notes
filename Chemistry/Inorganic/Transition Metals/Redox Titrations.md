[[Titration]] can be used to work out the concentration of a [[Reducing Agents|reducing]] or [[Oxidising Agents|oxidising agent]]
In this example, we look at finding the concentration of an oxidising agent by titrating against a reducing agent. 
1. Have your reducing agent solution with an unknown concentration but known volume in a conical flask
2. Add excess acid (e.g. sulfuric) to ensure you have sufficient $\ce{ H+ }$ [[ions]] to allow the reduction of the oxidising agent
3. Have your oxidising agent in a burette with a known concentration
4. Titrate the oxidising agent into the conical flask until a colour change occurs, this is the end point. Add drop by drop near the end point. Note that the colour change will be sharp
5. Read how much oxidising agent was added. Read from the bottom of the meniscus
6. Record results to 2 decimal places until you get 2 results that are concordant
You can swap the oxidising and reducing agents to do it the other way
To work out the concentration of the reagent:
1. Write out the equation of the reaction and balance it
2. Calculate the number of moles of the thing that's being titrated using the volume titrated
3. Use the equation to find out the molar ratio to work out thenumber of moles of the other substance
4. Finally calculate the concentration
