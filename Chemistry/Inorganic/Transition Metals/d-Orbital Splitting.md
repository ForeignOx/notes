The d-[[Electron Configuration|subshell]] is split into 2 when [[Ligands]] bond with a [[Transition Metals|transition metal]] to make a complex. This means that an energy gap is created when ligands are attached. This means that the ion has multiple [[Atomic Energy Levels|energy levels]]. This means when electrons absorb [[Photoelectric Effect|light energy]], some move from the lowest energy level, the ground state, to the higher energy level orbitals. In order for this to happen, the [[energy]] from the light must equal the difference in energy. The size of this energy gap is dependent on:
- The central metal ion and its [[Oxidation States|oxidation state]]
- The type of ligand
- The coordination number
The energy absorbed by the electrons can be calculated using this formula:
$$
\Delta E=h\nu=\frac{hc}{\lambda}
$$
Where $\Delta E$ is the change in energy, $h$ is Planck's constant, $\nu$ is the [[frequency]] of light absorbed, $c$ is the [[speed]] of light, and $\lambda$ is the [[wavelength]] of absorbed light
## Coloured Complexes
Some frequencies of visible light are absorbed by transition metal complexes. The frequencies absorbed depend on the size of $\Delta E$, the larger the energy gap, the higher the frequency. Any frequencies which are not absorbed are reflected or transmitted. The combination of these frequencies create a complementary colour that we observe with some complexes. For example, $\ce{ [Cu(H_{2}O)6]^2+ }$ absorbs frequencies that produce red light, the complimentary colour is light blue, so we observe this colour. For those complexes where we have a full or empty $\text{3d}$ subshell, no electrons can migrate to the higher energy level. This means we see these complexes as colourless or white
