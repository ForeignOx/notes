A ligand is an [[Ions|ion]], atom or molecule that has at least one lone pair of electrons. They can be monodentate, bidentate or multidentate
## Monodentate
Ligands which only have one lone pair of electrons are called monodentate (unidentate) ligands. Examples include $\ce{ H_{2}O:, :NH_{3}, :Cl- }$
## Bidentate
Ligands which have 2 lone pairs of electrons are called bidentate ligands. Examples include:
Ethanedioate:

## Multidentate
Ligands which have more than 1 coordinate bond are called multidentate ligands. $\ce{ EDTA^4- }$ is an example of a multidentate ligand. It can form 6 dative bonds with the central metal ion
