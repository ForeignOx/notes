Carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas that causes headaches, unconsciousness, and even death
If carbon monoxide is inhaled, the water [[Ligands|ligand]] in [[haemoglobin]] is replaced with a carbon monoxide ligand. Unfortunately, carbon monoxide bonds strongly so it's not readily replaced by oxygen or water. This means oxygen can't be transported and leads to oxygen starvation in organs. This is why carbon monoxide is poisonous
