In the manufacture of sulfuric acid, we use $\ce{ V_{2}O_{5} }$ ([[Vanadium]] V) as a [[Catalyst]]. It's used to catalyse $\ce{ SO_{2} }$ to $\ce{ SO_{3} }$. This is a heterogeneous catalyst
1. First $\ce{ V_{2}O_{5} }$ [[Redox|oxidises]] $\ce{ SO_{2} }$ to $\ce{ SO_{3} }$ and is itself reduced to $\ce{ V_{2}O_{4} }$:
$$
\ce{ V_{2}O_{5} +SO_{2} -> V_{2}O_{4} +SO_{3} }
$$
2. Second $\ce{ V_{2}O_{4} }$ is oxidised by oxygen to reform $\ce{ V_{2}O_{5} }$
$$
\ce{ V_{2}O_{4} +\frac{1}{2}O_{2} -> V_{2}O_{5} }
$$
