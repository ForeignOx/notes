Vanadium is a [[Transition Metals|transition metal]] that has a wide range of different [[oxidation states]] and colours. When transition metals change state, a [[Redox]] reaction occurs
$\ce{ VO_{2}+ }$ is the +5 oxidation state of Vanadium, and is also known as the Vanadate (V) [[ions|ion]], and is yellow. They can be reduced using Zinc in an acidic solution all the way to Vanadium (II) ions ($\ce{ V^2+ }$):
1. First, $\ce{ VO_{2}+ }$ is reduced to $\ce{ VO^2+ }$ and there is a colour change of yellow to blue:
$$
\ce{ 2VO_{2}+_{\text{(aq)}} +Zn_{\text{(s)}} +4H+_{\text{(aq)}} -> 2VO^2+_{\text{(aq)}} +Zn^2+_{\text{(aq)}} +2H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} }
$$
2. Then $\ce{ VO^2+ }$ is reduced to $\ce{ V^3+ }$ and there is a colour change of blue to green
$$
\ce{ 2VO^2+_{\text{(aq)}} +Zn_{\text{(s)}} +4H+_{\text{(aq)}} -> 2V^3+_{\text{(aq)}} +Zn^2+_{\text{(aq)}} +2H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} }
$$
3. Finally, $\ce{ V^3+ }$ is reduced to $\ce{ V^2+ }$ and there is a colour change from green to violet
$$
\ce{ 2V^3+_{\text{(aq)}} +Zn_{\text{(s)}} -> 2V^2+_{\text{(aq)}} +Zn^2+_{\text{(aq)}} }
$$
