A transition element is a [[d-block Elements|d-block element]] that can from at least one stable [[ions|ion]] with a partially filled d-subshell. The d-subshell can hold up to 10 electrons
## Period 4 Transition Metals
For period 4 d-block elements, only 8 of them are transition metals. Scandium and Zinc are not transition elements, as they don't form a stable ion with a partially filled d-subshell. Below are the [[Electron Configuration|electron configurations]] of the 8 transition elements in period 4. You can see they fill up singly first then double up. This is because electrons repel each other
![[Pasted image 20240424214957.png]]
Notice how Chromium and Copper behave differently; an electron from the $\text{4s}$ orbital moves into the $\text{3d}$ orbital to create a more stable half full or full $\text{3d}$ sub-shell respectively
## Electron Configuration of [[Ions]]
Transition metals lose electrons in a specific way to form ions. They first lose electrons in the $\text{s}$-subhsell, then the $\text{d}$-subshell
## Properties of Transition Metals
Transition metals have specific properties which include variable [[oxidation states]], form coloured ions in solution and are good [[Catalyst|catalysts]]
Transition metals have variable oxidation states because the electrons sit in $\text{4s}$ and $\text{3d}$ [[Atomic Energy Levels|energy levels]] which are very close. As a result, electrons are gained and lost using a similar amount of energy when they form the ions seen in the table below

Remember [[Scandium and Zinc]] are not transition elements
### Metal Complexes
Another property of transition metals is their ability to form complex ions. A complex ion is where a central transition metal ion is surrounded by [[ligands]] bonded by [[Dative Covalent bond|dative covalent bonds]]
![[Pasted image 20240425213914.png]]
Ligands must have at least 1 pair of lone electrons. Complex ions can come in many [[Shapes of Molecules|shapes]]
### Complex Shapes
The shape is dependent on the size of the ligands and the coordination number. Note that the coordination number is the number of coordinate (dative) bonds in a complex. It's not the number of ligands
- Some ligands are small, and you can fit 6 of them around a central metal ion. Examples of these include $\ce{ H_{2}O: }$ and $\ce{ :NH_{3} }$. These form octahedral shapes
- Some ligands are larger, and you can only fit 4 of them around the central metal ion. An example of this is $\ce{ :Cl- }$. These form tetrahedral and square planar shapes. A specific example of a square planar complex is the anti-cancer drug cisplatin ($\ce{ Pt[(NH_{3})2(Cl)2] }$):
    ![[Pasted image 20240429205149.png]]
- Complexes with a coordination number of 2 form linear shapes. These have bond angles of $180^{\circ}$. Some specific examples are some silver complexes such as $\ce{ [Ag(NH_{3})2]+ }$, [[Tollens' reagent]]:
    ![[Pasted image 20240429205019.png]]
Bidentate and multidentate ligands take up even more spaces on the metal as they occupy multiple of the '6' places to bond
### Overall Charge
Complexes have an overall charge which is the same as its total oxidation state
$$
\text{Total oxidation state of metal}=\text{Total oxidation state}-\text{Total oxidation state of ligands}
$$
## Substitution Reactions
A [[d-Orbital Splitting|colour change]] can exist when ligands in a complex exchange. These substitution reactions show ligands of a similar size being exchanged, for example:
$$
\underbrace{\ce{ [Co(H_{2}O)6]^2+_{\text{(aq)}}}}_{\text{Pink}} \ce{  +6NH_{3}_{\text{(aq)}} -> } \underbrace{\ce{ [Co(NH_{3})6]^2+_{\text{(aq)}}}}_{\text{Pale Yellow}} \ce{ +6H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} }
$$
Both ammonia and water are similar sized ligands and same charges, so the complex shape remains octahedral
A similar thing occurs with copper however, it only partially substitutes:
$$
\underbrace{\ce{ [Cu(H_{2}O)6]^2+_{\text{(aq)}} }}_{\text{Blue}} \ce{ +4NH_{3}_{\text{(aq)}} -> } \underbrace{\ce{ [Cu(NH_{3})4(H_{2}O)2]^2+_{\text{(aq)}} }}_{\text{Dark Blue}}\ce{ +4H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} }
$$
Here the substitution is partial as the reaction occurs when $\ce{ [Cu(H_{2}O)6]^2+_{\text{(aq)}} }$ reacts with excess ammonia
These substitution reactions show ligands of a different size being exchanged:
$$
\underbrace{\ce{  [Co(H_{2}O)6]^2+_{\text{(aq)}}}}_{\text{Pink Octahedral}}\ce{+4Cl-_{\text{(aq)}}  ->} \underbrace{\ce{ [CoCl_{4}]^2-_{\text{(aq)}} }}_{\text{Blue Tetrahedral}}\ce{ +6H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} }
$$
$\ce{ Cl- }$ is a larger ligand than $\ce{ H_{2}O }$ or $\ce{ NH_{3} }$. Only $4\ce{ Cl- }$ ion ligands can fit round, so we have a change in shape and coordination number. Here are some more examples:
$$
\underbrace{\ce{  [Cu(H_{2}O)6]^2+_{\text{(aq)}}}}_{\text{Blue Octahedral}}\ce{+4Cl-_{\text{(aq)}}  ->} \underbrace{\ce{ [CuCl_{4}]^2-_{\text{(aq)}} }}_{\text{Yellow Tetrahedral}}\ce{ +6H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} }
$$
$$
\underbrace{\ce{  [Fe(H_{2}O)6]^2+_{\text{(aq)}}}}_{\text{Yellow Octahedral}}\ce{+4Cl-_{\text{(aq)}}  ->} \underbrace{\ce{ [FeCl_{4}]^2-_{\text{(aq)}} }}_{\text{Yellow Tetrahedral}}\ce{ +6H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} }
$$
Different ligands can form different strength bonds to the metal ion. For example, the $\ce{ CN- }$ ions from stronger bonds than the $\ce{ H_{2}O }$ molecules. This means this reaction is not easily reversed. The new complex formed is more stable. 
$$
\ce{ [Fe(H_{2}O)6]^3+_{\text{(aq)}} +6CN-_{\text{(aq)}} -> [Fe(CN)6]^3-_{\text{(aq)}} +6H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} }
$$
Multidentate ligands also form complexes that are more stable than monodentate ligands
$$
\ce{ [Cu(H_{2}O)6]^2+_{\text{(aq)}} +3NH_{2}CH_{2}CH_{2}NH_{2}_{\text{(aq)}} -> [Cu(NH_{2}CH_{2}CH_{2}NH_{2})3]^2+_{\text{(aq)}} +6H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} }
$$
Increasing [[entropy]] forms a more stable complex. In a ligand exchange reaction, bonds are broken in the original complex and new ones are formed to make a new complex. Quite often, the energy needed to break the bonds is similar to the energy released when new ones are formed. The enthalpy change may be very small, like in the reaction above. This reaction is not considered reversible as the $\ce{ [Cu(NH_{2}CH_{2}CH_{2}NH_{2})]^2+ }$ product is much more stable than the $\ce{ [Cu(H_{2}O)6]^2+ }$. This is despite the enthalpy change is small. The increase in stability is known as the chelate effect. When we substitute monodentate ligands with bidentate and multidentate ligands, we create a solution with more particles in it. This means we have an increase in entropy. Reactions that have an increase in entropy are more likely to happen due to [[Gibb's Free Energy]]. Looking at $\ce{ EDTA^4- }$ for example, you will see that the number of particles increases, so the entropy increases too. It's difficult to reverse this reaction, as this would mean a decrease in entropy:
$$
\ce{ [Cr(H_{2}O)6]^3+_{\text{(aq)}} +EDTS^4-_{\text{(aq)}} -> [Cr(EDTA)]-_{\text{(aq)}} +6H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} }
$$
This goes from 2 to 7 particles, so is entropically favourable
## [[Redox]] Potentials
Redox potentials tell us how easily an ion is reduced, which is the same as [[Electrode Potential|electrode potentials]]. The least stable ions have the largest redox potential and are more likely to be reduced. For example, consider the half equations below:
$$
\ce{ Zn^2+_{\text{(aq)}} +2e- <=> Zn_{\text{(s)}} }\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, E^{\theta}=-0.76
$$
$$
\ce{ Cu^2+_{\text{(aq)}} +2e- <=> Cu_{\text{(s)}} }\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, E^{\theta}=+0.34
$$
Here, $\ce{ Cu^2+ }$ has an $E^{\theta}$ value of $+0.34\pu{ V}$ and is less stable than $\ce{ Zn^2+ }$ which has a lower $E^{\theta}$. Note $E^{\theta}$ values require [[standard conditions]]. There may be a difference in redox potential to the standard values seen in a data book. It is dependent on the environment the ions are in
### Ligands
For ligands, standard electrode potentials are always measured in aqueous solutions. The metal ion is surrounded by water molecules. However, ligands other than water can form stronger bonds to the metal ions with particular oxidation states. This means the redox potential can be higher or lower than the standard value
### [[pH]]
The pH of the solution affects the size of redox potentials with some reactions. Generally, the more acidic the solution, the larger the electrode potential. This means the ion is more easily reduced
For example in the equation below, $\ce{ H+ }$ ions are required for reduction:
$$
\ce{ MnO_{2}_{\text{(aq)}} +4H+_{\text{(aq)}} +2e- <=> Mn^2+_{\text{(aq)}} +2H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} }
$$
Here, $\ce{ OH- }$ ions are produced into solution when reduced
$$
\ce{ PbO_{2}_{\text{(aq)}} +H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} +2e- <=> Mn^2+_{\text{(aq)}} +2H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} }
$$
