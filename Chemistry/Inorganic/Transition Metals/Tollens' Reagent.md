Tollens' reagent contains the [[Transition Metals|transition element]] silver which forms a complex that is used to distinguish between aldehydes and ketones
The half equation has a large [[Electrode Potential]], $E^{\theta}$ value which means $\ce{ Ag+ }$ is easily [[Redox|reduced]] to silver metal:
$$
\ce{ Ag+_{\text{(aq)}} +e- <=> Ag_{\text{(s)}} } \tag{ $E^{\theta}=+0.8\pu{ V}$}
$$
Tollens' is made by reacting enough aqueous ammonia to aqueous silver nitrate. Colourless $\ce{ [Ag(NH_{3})2]+ }$ is produced. When this is added to an aldehyde, the $\ce{ Ag+ }$ [[Ions]] are reduced to produce a silver mirror. The [[Aldehydes|aldehyde]] is oxidised to a [[Carboxylic Acids|carboxylic acid]]. The reaction is:
$$
\ce{ RCHO_{\text{(aq)}} +2[Ag(NH_{3})2]+_{\text{(aq)}} +3OH-_{\text{(aq)}} -> RCOO-_{\text{(aq)}} +2Ag_{\text{(s)}} +4NH_{3}_{\text{(aq)}} +2H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} }
$$
## Testing
Tollens' reagent can be used to distinguish between aldehydes and [[Ketones]] using the above reaction, which will only occur with aldehydes. When Tollen's is added warm to aldehydes, it is reduced to silver which coats the inside of the flask causing the silver mirror
