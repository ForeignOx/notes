Proton [[NMR spectroscopy]] tells us how many hydrogen environments there are and how many hydrogens are in each environment in the sample. The number of peaks on a proton NMR spectrum tells us the number of different hydrogen environments. The areas under the peaks tells us the relative number of hydrogens in each environment
The proton NMR chemical shifts have values, and hydrogen environments can be determined using a table of standard values. This is done by matching up the position of the peaks in the spectrum to the table to work out what hydrogen environment is in the sample
Proton NMR spectra have peaks that split. This allows us to determine structure. Peaks that split into smaller peaks are reffered to as a splitting pattern. The number of smaller peaks corresponds to the number of hydrogen atoms on the adjecent carbon atoms plus one
For example:
- A singlet peak means that there are 0 hydrogens on neighbouring carbons
- A doublet peak means that there is 1 hydrogen on neighbouring carbons
- A triplet peak means that there are 2 hydrogens on neighbouring carbons
- A quartet peak means that there are 3 hydrogens on neighbouring carbons, ect.
Substances to be tested are dissolved in non-hydrogen based solvents to aboid confusing spectra. We can't use water, for example, as this would show peaks in the spectrum. We instead use solvents like deuterated substances, as they do not have hydrogen. $\ce{ D_{2}O }$ is an example, where $\ce{ D }$ is an isotope of a hydrogen atom with 2 nucleons (so will not spin). An alternative is $\ce{ CCl_{4} }$
