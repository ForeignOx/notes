The peaks on a carbon 13 [[NMR Spectroscopy|NMR spectrum]] tells us the number of different carbon environments as there is a different amount of electron shielding for each one
The spectra of cyclic compounds are more difficult to predict. In these cases, we look for symmetry in which atoms are in different environments
The carbon 13 NMR chemical shifts have values and carbon environments can be determined using a table of standard values by matching up the position of the peaks in the spectrum to the table to work out what carbon environments are in the sample
There are some issues however:
- A peak at 190 will suggest a carbonyl group, however, we can't be sure if theis is an aldehyde or ketone
- There are overlaps, so a peak at 60 could be an amine, alcohol, ester, or ether
