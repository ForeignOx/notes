## Complex Ions of [[Transition Metals]]
Complex ions also show cis-trans isomerism. 
### Octahedral Complexes
For example, if [[Shapes of Molecules|octahedral]] complexes have 4 [[ligands]] of the same type and 2 ligands of a different type, this is the case

### Square Planar Complexes
Square planar complexes with 2 ligands of the same type and 2 ligands of a different type display cis-trans isomerism
