[[Alkenes|Cyclohexene]] is made from [[Alcohols|cyclohexanol]] using [[Distillation]], separation, and purification techniques
## 1. Distillation
Add concentrated sulfurric, phosphoric acid and cyclohexanol into a round bottomed flask. Add several anti-bumping granules to allow a smooth boiling process. Use a heating mantle to warm the reactants to $83^{\circ}\pu{ C}$; the boiling point of cyclohexanol. We don't want to use a bunsen burner to heat this, as cyclohexanol is flammable. Chemicals with boiling points less than $83^{\circ}\pu{ C}$ will evaporate, enter the condenser, cool down and condense back into a liquid. The condenser has cold running water running through the wall. The product is collected in a vessel such as a conical flask. However, this product will stil have small amounds of impurities such as unreacted cyclohexanol and water
## 2. Separation
Add the products from step 1 into a separating funnel. Add water to dissolve soluble impurities and create an aqueous solution. After allowing the solution to settle, 2 layers will form. The top layer will be impure cyclohexene, the bottom layer will be an aqueous layer containing water-soluble impurities. Drain the aqueous layer off
## 3. Purification
Take the impure cyclohexene from step 2 and add to a round bottomed flask. Add anhydrous $\ce{ CaCl_{2} }$. This is a dehydrating agent and will remove aqueous substances still remaining. Invert the flask and leave for 20-30 minutes
