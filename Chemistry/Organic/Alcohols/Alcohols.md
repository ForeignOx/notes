Alcohols have the functional group $\ce{ -OH }$ (hydroxyl) in its [[homologous series]]
There are three main types of alcohols:

## Dehydration of Alcohols
[[Alkenes]] can be made sustainably from alcohols - providing the alcohol has been made via fermentation of glucose from plants
We can [[Elimination|eliminate]] water from an alcohol to produce an alkene. Because we are eliminating water, we call it dehydration. By using alcohol made from fermentation of plants, we are making alkenes more sustainably than from [[cracking]] crude oil, which is non-renewable. The ellimination reaction involves the use of an [[Brønsted–Lowry Acids|acid]] catalyst; either sulfuric acid of phosphoric acid

If the $\ce{ R_{1} }$ group is also an alkyl group, then one of the hydrogens on that alkyl group can form the double bond in stage 3 instead, which would mean that two different alkenes could be produced
Dehydration of alcohols is conducted via [[distillation]] as we get an impure product containing alkene, alcohol, water, and acid. We separate the alkene by distillation
## Hydration of Alkenes to Produce Alcohols
Alcohols are produced by the hydration of alkenes. We use steam and an acid catalyst to create an alcohol. High temperature and pressure is needed. The process is the [[electrophilic addition]] of water

Note that as with most electrophilic addition reactions, multiple products are made; the $\ce{ OH }$ group could be on the other carbon
## Oxidation of Alcohols
Alcohols can be oxidised to [[aldehydes]], [[ketones]], and [[carboxylic acids]]. Alcohols are oxidised using acidified potassium dichromate, $\ce{ K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7} }$. This is a mild [[Oxidising Agents|oxidising agent]], so is [[redox|reduced]] itself. It will turn from orange to green. Distillation and [[reflux]] is used in the oxidation of alcohols
Primary alcohols can be oxidised to aldehydes, then caboxylic acids. It is difficult to extract an aldehyde when heating just in a boiling tube we have to remove the aldehyde from the oxidising agent when it forms using distillation. We use reflux and excess oxidising agent to make carboxylic acids. Reflux allows strong heating without losing volatile reactants and products. Aldehydes evaporate, condense and fall back into the flask
Secondary alcohols can be oxidised to ketones. It is difficult to oxidise ketones further. Use reflux to make a ketone
Tertiary alcohols can't be oxidised by dichromate, but they can be oxidised by being combusted, but that doesn't release useful products
