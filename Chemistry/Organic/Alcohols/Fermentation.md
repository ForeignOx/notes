Fermentation is an alternative to [[alkenes|ethene]] and steam when making [[alcohols|ethanol]]. Making ethanol via fermentation uses a renewable source of glucose from plants. Fermentation uses yeast in anaerobic conditions (little to no oxygen). The reaction is exothermic. The reaction is:
$$
\ce{ C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}_{\text{(aq)}} -> 2C_{2}H_{5}OH_{\text{(aq)}} +2CO_{2}_{\text{(g)}} }
$$
Yeast is an enzyme, and it converts glucose into $\ce{ CO_{2} }$ and ethanol, it has an optimum temperature of $30-40^{\circ}\pu{ C}$. The reaction is too slow at low temperatures. The enzyme is denatured at high temperaures. [[Fractional distillation]] is used to obtain pure ethanol. Fermentation requires little equipment and uses renewable resources, so is a cheap process. The biggest cost is fractional distillation at the end, which requires energy and time
