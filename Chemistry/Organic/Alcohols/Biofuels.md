Biofuels such as [[alcohols|ethanol]] are made from dead biological matter. Ethanol is being used as a fuel in countries where there is a good supply of sugar cane. Brazil is one of the biggest users of biofuels, which are added to petrol. The sugar is [[Fermentation|fermented]] to produce the alcohol
## Advantages
Biofuels are renewable, so they are more sustainable than crude oil. Biofuels produce $\ce{ CO_{2} }$ when they are burnt however, they are classed as carbon-neutral as the $\ce{ CO_{2} }$ is absorbed by the sugar can when it's growing
Plants take in 6 moles of $\ce{ CO_{2} }$ to make 1 mole of glucose via photosynthesis:
$$
\ce{ 6CO_{2} +6H_{2}O -> C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} +6O_{2} }
$$
During the fermentation process, ethanol is produced alongside 2 moles of $\ce{ CO_{2} }$
$$
\ce{ C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} -> 2CO_{2} +2C_{2}H_{5}OH }
$$
Combustion of ethanol produces 4 moles of carbon dioxide:
$$
\ce{ 2C_{2}H_{5}OH +6O_{2} -> 4CO_{2} +6H_{2}O }
$$
The total number of moles of $\ce{ CO_{2} }$ used up is the same as the number produced, so it is carbon-neutral. It's not completely carbon-neutral though as some fossil fuels are burnt to transport the biofuel across the country, fossil fuels are used to make fertilisers put on the cfrops and on the machinery to harvest the crop
## Disadvantages
Expensive to convert existing petrol engines to take fuels with a higher concentration of ethanol. Land that could have been used to grow food is being used to make fuel. This could cause foold shortages in countries that grow sugar cane
