An amine is derived from ammonia molecules and all contain a nitrogen atom where hydrogens are replaced with an organic group:

## Amines as a [[Brønsted–Lowry Bases|Base]]
Amines have a lone pair of electrons that allows them to ccept a proton and hence they act as a base. A proton bonds to an amine via a [[Dative Covalent bond]]. Both electrons in the bond originate from the lone pair on the Nitrogen

The strength of the base is dependent on the availability of the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen. The higher the electron density, the more readily abailable the electrons are. Electron density on the nitrogen is dependent on the type of group attached to the nitrogen
The order of base strength is as follows:
$$
\text{Aromatic Amines } <\text{ Ammonia }<\text{ Primary Aliphatic Amines}
$$
The reason for this is that [[Benzene]] is an electron withdrawing group so it pulls electrons away from nitrogen into the ring structure. Electron density at nitrogen reduces so lone pair availability is reduced and [[Arenes|aromatic]] amines are less basic
Alkyl groups are electron pushing groups so they push electrons towards Nitrogen. Electron density at Nitrogen increases, so lone pair availability is increased, and primary aliphatic amines are more basic
## Making Aliphatic Amines
### Reacting [[Halogenoalkanes]] with Excess Ammonia
There is a [[Nucleophilic Substitution]] reaction between the ammonia and the [[Halogens|halogen]]

This method doesn't just produce primary amines, but also secondary, tertiary, and quaternary salts since the amines can act as the [[Nucleophiles]] that ammonia is in the first stage. This means this method produces an impure product
### Reducing [[Nitriles]] 
The cheapest way to make primary amines in industry is to reduce nitriles using hydrogen gas and a nickel or platinum catalyst. The reaction is called catalytic hydrogenation, and unlike using halogenoalkanes as above, this raction only produced primary amines, so a pure product is made. The overall reaction is:
$$
\ce{ R-C#N +2H_{2} ->[\text{Nickel}] R-CH_{2}NH_{2} }
$$
The conditions for this are high temperature and pressure
Another way to reduce nitriles is to use a strong [[Reducing Agents|reducing agent]] such as $\ce{ LiAlH_{4}}$ and dilute [[Brønsted–Lowry Acids|acid]]. This method is more expensive. The overall reaction is this:
$$
\ce{ R-C#N +4[H] -> R-CH_{2}NH_{2} }
$$
## Making Aromatic Amines
Aromatic amines are made by reducing nitro compounds such as [[Nitration of Benzene|nitrobenzene]]. Aromatic amines are used to make dye stuffs and pharmaceuticals. We heat (under [[Reflux]]) nitrobenzene with concentrated $\ce{ HCl }$ and tin to form a salt. The salt produced then is reacted with an alkali such as $\ce{ NaOH }$ to produce an aromatic amine such as phenylamine
