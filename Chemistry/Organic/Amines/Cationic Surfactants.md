Quaternary [[Amines|ammonium]] salts are used to make cleaning products such as shampoo, landry detergents and washing up liquids. Quaternary salts are made up from a positive end and are attracted to negative ions. An example is tetramethylammonium chloride

Quaternary ammonium salts have a long hydrocarbon tail which is called a cationic surfactant. They work simply by the non-[[Polar Bonds|polar]] tail being attracted to the oil/grease. The polar head will be attracted to the water. This now allows the water and the oil to mix and removes grease from clothing, skin and dishes
The positive ammonium ion in cationic surgactants is also attracted to negatively charged fibres and hair. This removes static, so is used in hair conditioner and fabric softener
