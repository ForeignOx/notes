Condensation [[Polymers|polymerisation]] is where 2 different monomers with at least 2 functional groups react together. When they react, a link is made, and water is eliminated. The link determines the type of prolymer produced
## Polypeptides
Polypeptides, also known as [[Proteins]] are made up of [[Amino Acids|amino acid]] monomert units. The link that joins them is called a peptide link:

The protein can be broken down into amino acids via hydrolysis, however it requires severe conditions - $6\pu{ mol dm-3}\ce{ HCl }$, $110^{\circ}\pu{ C}$ under [[Reflux]] for 24 hours 
## Polyamides
Polyamides are formed by reacting [[Carboxylic Acids|dicarboxylic acids]] and [[Amines|diamines]] together, which forms an [[Amides|amide]] link:

### Kevlar
Kevlar is a polyamide that is used in bulletproof vests, car tyres and some sports equipment as it is lightweight, but strong. It is made from [[Benzene]]-1,4-dicarboxylic acid and 1,4-diaminobenzene

### Nylon 6,6
Nylon 6,6 is a polyamide that is used in ropes, carpets, clothing, and parachute fabric. It is made from hexandioic acid and 1,6-diaminohexane

## Polyesters
Polyesters are fomed by reacting dicarboxylic acids and [[Alcohols|diols]] together, which forms an ester link:

### Terylene
Terylene is a polyester that is used in plastic drinks bottles, sheeting, and clothes. It is also known as PET. It is made from benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid and ethane-1,2-diol:

## Hydrolysis
Condensation polymers can be hydrolysed to produce the original monomers, this is the exact reverse of the reaction to form them
## Polarity
Condensation polymers have [[Polar Bonds]] caused by $\ce{ C-O }$ and $\ce{ C-N }$ bonds that exist in polymers. Condensation polymers are usually more rigid and stronger than their addition polymer counterparts, this is because [[Hydrogen Bonds]] form between the polymer chains, as well as [[Dipole-Dipole Forces|dipole-dipole]] and [[Van der Waals Forces]]. This makes condensation polymers stronger than [[Addition Polymers]]
Due to their polar bonds however, condensation polymers are susceptible to attack from [[Nucleophiles]]. They are biodegradable and broken down by hydrolysis slowly
