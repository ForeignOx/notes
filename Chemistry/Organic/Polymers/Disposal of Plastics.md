Most plastics are not biodegradable, so need to be disposed of carefully
## Landfill
Landfill is useful for disposing of plastics that:
- Are too difficult to recycle
- Are too difficult to separate from other materials
- There is not enough plastic to extract to make it economically viable
When waste decomposes in landfill, it produces methane which is a [[Global Warming|greenhouse gas]]. There is also a risk of water contamination from waste leaching
Landfill is not very sustainable as large amounts of land is needed. It is becoming increasingly expensive to use land for waste disposal and there is a need to reduce our reliance on landfill
## Incineration
Incineration is burning of waste. Burning waste plastics can be used if the plastics can't be recycled. The energy from burning them can be used to generate electricity. Burning plastics can release toxic fumes, so these need to be monitored. Particularly chlorine based plastics like [[PVC]] which produce harmful $\ce{ HCl }$ gas when burned
Flue gas [[Wet Scrubbing|scrubbers]] are used to neutralise [[Brønsted–Lowry Acids|acidic]] gases produced like $\ce{ HCl }$. They work by reacting a [[Brønsted–Lowry Bases|base]] with the flue gases
## Recycling
Most plastics are made from crude oil, which is a non-renewable source. Recycling will reduce the dependency on crude oil for making plastics. Some plastics like polypropene can be re-moulded into new objects. Orher plastics can be [[Cracking|cracked]] into monomers to be used as organic feedstock for plastics or other substances
### Advantages to Recycling
- It is cheaper to recycle plastics than make them from scratch
- Less carbon dioxide is produced recycling plastics than incinerating them
- Recycling reduces the reliance on landfill
- Recycling preserves non-renewable raw materials such as crude oil
### Disadvantages to Recycling
- Plastcs can be contaminated with other materials when being recycled
- It is difficult to recycle plastics due to the wide variety of different plastics
- It is difficult to re-make the original plastic from recycled material
- Sorting and processing plastics to be recycled is expensive compared with incineration
