Amino acids have an [[amines|amino]] group ($\ce{ -NH_{2} }$) and a [[Carboxylic Acids|carboxyl]] group ($\ce{ -COOH }$). $\alpha$ amino acids look like this:

Amino acids are [[Amphoteric Substances|amphoteric]] due to the basic nature of the amino group and the acidic nature of the carboxyl group. Except for glycine, where the $\ce{ R }$ group is hydrogen, are [[Chiral Centres|chiral]] molecules as they have 4 different groups arount a central carbon atom. They rotate plane [[Polarisation|polarised]] light
Amino acids can exist as [[zwitterions]], but they only exist at the amino acid's isoelectric point - the [[pH]] at which the areage overall charge is zero. This is dependent on the $\ce{ R }$ group. Both the carboxyl and amino groups are ionised, and it looks like this:

If the pH is lower than the isoelectric point, the $\ce{ COO- }$ group is likely to accept an $\ce{ H+ }$, so the amino acid will look like this:

If the pH is higher than the isoelectric point, then the $\ce{ NH_{3}+ }$ is likely to lose an $\ce{ H+ }$, so the amino acid will look like this:
