Proteins are large, complex molecules, and they have 4 levels of structure: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary
## Primary Structure
A primary protein structure shows the individual sequence of [[amino acids]] that make up the proteins

## Secondary Structure
[[Hydrogen bonds]] exist between the peptide links in the polymer chain, and this pulls a straight chain into a coiled ($\alpha$) or pleated ($\beta$) structure

## Tertiary Structure
The protein chain is long and oten it coils itself up giving a unique shape for that protein. This is known as the tertiary protein structure and additional bonds hold the long coiled chain together

## Quaternary Structure
Some proteins form assemblies with other molecules. This is called the quaternary structure

## Forces Holding Proteins Together
[[Intermolecular forces]] crreate the twisting features of secondary and tertiary structures. This gives proteins a specific 3D shape that is vital as this determines basic functions. Temperature and [[pH]] also change the shape of proteins by affecting hydrogen bonding and the formation of disulfide bonds. There are two main types of bonds that hold a protein shape
### Disulfide Bonds
Cysteine is an amino acid that has a thiol group:
```smiles
C([C@@H](C(=O)O)N)S
```
Thiols can lose the $\ce{ H }$ atom and the sulfur atoms can bond forming a disulphide ($\ce{ S-S }$) bond
### Hydrogen Bonding
Hydrogen bonding exists between the highly electronegative elements like $\ce{ O }$ and $\ce{ N }$ in amino acids and $\ce{ H }$. The most common form is in the $\ce{ -NH_{2} }$ and $\ce{ -OH }$ sections of amino acids
