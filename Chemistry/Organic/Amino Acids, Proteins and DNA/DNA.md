Deoxyribonucleic acid (aka DNA) is a [[Polymers|polymer]] that is made up of monomers called nucleotides. Nucleotides are made from 3 main components - a phosphate, a sugar, and a base
Phosphate group:
```smiles
P(=O)([O-])(O)(O)
```
Pentose Sugar (2-deoxyribose)
```smiles
OCC1C(O)CC(O)O1
```
There are 4 main bases:
Adenine (A)
```smiles
Nc1c2ncNc2ncn1
```

Cytosine (C)
```smiles
O=C1Nccc(N)n1
```
Thymine (T)
```smiles
O=C1NC(=O)NC=C1C
```
Guanine (G)
```smiles
O=C1c2ncnc2nc(N)N1
```
Together these make 4 nucleotides, one for each base:
Adenine nucleotide:
```smiles
Nc3c4ncN(C1CC(O)C(COP(=O)([O-])O)O1)c4ncn3
```
Cytosine nucleotide:
```smiles
O=C1N(C2CC(O)C(COP(=O)([O-])O)O2)ccc(N)n1
```
Thymine nucleotide:
```smiles
O=C1NC(=O)N(C3CC(O)C(COP(=O)([O-])O)O3)C=C1C
```
Guanine nucleotide:
```smiles
O=C1c2ncn(C3CC(O)C(COP(=O)([O-])O)O3)c2nc(N)N1
```
The $\ce{ OH }$ groups on the phosphate and the sugar then can create phosphodiester bonds, eliminating water to create the polynuclotide strand
DNA is formed from 2 polynucleotide strands that are twisted together to form a double helix. The polynucleotide strands are held together by [[hydrogen bonds]] between the bases. The bases connect in a specific way: adenine bonds with thymine, cytosine bonds with guanine
This means that both strands in DNA are complementary, which means where there is adenine on one strand, it will align and bond with thymine on the other strand, and the same goes with cytosine and guanine
This is how the bonds look:

No other base pairings can happen as the partially charged atoms would be too close to each other and repel, or not get close enough for a hydrogen bond to form
