Cis-platin is an anti-cancer drug, which is a [[Shapes of Molecules|square planar]] [[Transition Metals|complex]] with a platinum metal ion, 2 ammonia [[ligands]] and 2 chloride ion ligands. Cis-platin is specifically the [[Cis-Trans Isomerism|cis isomer]] as the chloride ligands have to be adjacent

Cis-platin binds to [[DNA]] in cancer cells. As the complex is attached to the DNA, it prevents the cell from reproducing through cell division. The cell dies as it is unable to repair itself. The way this works is tht the chloride [[ions]] in the complex are easy to displace and can detach from the complex. The platinum ion can then bond to the nitrogen atoms ona guanine base within DNA. Another guanine base can do the same with the second cis-platin. As cis-platin bonds to the DNA, it creates a distortion in the DNA strand. This means it can't unwind and be copied
However, cis-platin also prevents healthy cells from reproducing. For example, it affects cells in the blood, which can suppress the immune system and increase the risk of infection and kidney damage. It can also prevent hair cell regeneration. These side effects can be reduced by giving lower doses and using a more targeted delivery of the drug to reduce the attack of healthy cells. Despite the short term side effects, cis-platin is still used in chemotherapy treatment of cancer due to the long term benefits it can bring in eliminating cancer
