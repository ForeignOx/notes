An electrophilic addition reaction is a reaction in which a substrate is initially attacked by an [[Electrophiles|electrophile]], and the overall result is the addition of one or more relatively simple molecules across a multiple bond. This is the [[Chemical Mechanisms|mechanism]]:

This produces a carbocation intermediate (the carbon with the positive charge)
Usually the electrophile is also bonded to another (usually negatively charged) molecule that will then bond to the carbocation
The amount of the 2 products is determined by the stability of the carbocation intermediate. The more alkyl groups bonded to the carbocation, the more stable the intermediate is. This is because the alkyl groups push electrons towards the positive carbocation, stabilising it. The more stable the carbocation, the more likely it will form:
