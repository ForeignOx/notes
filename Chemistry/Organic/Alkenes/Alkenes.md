Alkenes are unsaturated [[hydrocarbons]] with the [[general formula]] of $\ce{ C_{n}H_{2n} }$ (if they have 1 double bond, if they have more, remove 2 additional hydrogens for each one). They are characterised by having at least one double covalent $\ce{ C=C }$ double bond. They can undergo [[addition reactions]]. The double bonds have high electron density, making them fairly reactive 
## [[Electrophilic Addition]] Reactions
### Addition of Bromine
A test for alkenes is the decolouration of bromine water, this happens because bromine (brown-orange) is an electrophile and adds to the alkene forming a [[halogenoalkanes|dibromoalkane]]

The reason this occurs is that the bromine is polarised by the electrons in the double bond
### Addition of Hydrogen Halides
Alkenes react with hydrogen halides to form halogenoalkanes

Reacting hydrogen halides with unsymmetrical alkenes produces 2 different products
### Addition of Sulfuric Acid
Alkenes react with cold, concentrated sulfuric acid to form alkyl hydrogen sulfates

This also can produce two different products. The alkyl hydrogen sulfate can then react with cold water and undergo a hydrolysis reaction to produce an [[alcohols|alcohol]] and reform the sulfuric acid
## [[Addition Polymers]]
Alkenes are monomers which join together to form addition [[polymers]] by breaking their double bond

Poly(alkenes) are [[Saturated Compounds|saturated]] molecules, normally non-polar and hence are unreactive. They don't degrade well in landfill
Intermolecular forces govern the properties of polymers. Most polyalkene chains are non-polar, so they only have [[Van der Waals forces]] between the chains. The longer the chain and the closer they are to each other, the stronger these forces are. Polymer chains which are shorter and have a lot of branching tend to be more flexible and weaker. Polyers with no or very little branching and are long tend to be more rigid and stronger. Some polyalkenes have [[halogens]] which can form stronger permanent [[dipole-dipole forces]] and so will have different properties to other non-[[Polar bonds|polar]] polyalkenes
