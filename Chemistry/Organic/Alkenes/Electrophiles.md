An electrophile is an electron pair acceptor, they are deficient in electrons and are attracted to electron rich areas such as double bonds
Examples of electrophiles include either positively charged ions such as:
- $\ce{ NO_{2}+ }$
- $\ce{ H+ }$
Ore polar molecules:
- $\ce{ HBr }$
- $\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} }$
