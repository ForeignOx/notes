Plasticisers are added to [[Polymers]] to change their properties. Plasticisers make polymers more flexible as they slide between the polymer chains, pushing them apart. This weakens the [[Intermolecular Forces]] between the chains. The chains can now slide over each other more, which makes them easier to bend
