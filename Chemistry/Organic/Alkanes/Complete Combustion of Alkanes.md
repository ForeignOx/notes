[[Alkanes]] burn in oxygen completely if there is a prentiful supply of $\ce{ O_{2} }$ to form carbon dioxide and water. Alkanes are good fuels, as most burn readily to produce large amounts of energy. They are used to power vehicles, and most of Britain's electricity is made using the combustion of alkanes. The general reaction for this process is:
$$
\ce{ C_{n}H_{2n+2}_{\text{(g)}} + \left( \frac{3n +1}{2} \right)O_{2}_{\text{(g)}} -> nCO_{2}_{\text{(g)}} +(n +1)H_{2}O_{\text{(g)}} }
$$
