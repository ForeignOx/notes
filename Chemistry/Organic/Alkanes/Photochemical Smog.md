Ozone is found in the lowest level of the atmosphere. This exists as sunlight, [[Hydrocarbons]] and nitrogen dioxide mix to form ozone. A great deal of hydrocarbons and nitrogen dioide comes from cars and factories. When solid carbon particulates and ozone mix, we create photochemical smog
Photochemical smog harms the respiratory system in animals and damages plants. Ozone is also toxic to humans. Catalytic converters help to reduce the amount of unburnt hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen going into the atmosphere
