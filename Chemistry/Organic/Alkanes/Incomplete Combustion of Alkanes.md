When [[Alkanes]] burn with a limited supply of oxygen, they produce [[Carbon Monoxide]] and carbon (soot); incomplete combustion occurs. Soot causes breathing problems, makes building dirty and clogs up engines. Carbon monoxide can be removed using a catalytic converter
There is not one reaction that demonstrates this process, as a mixture of $\ce{ CO_{2} }$, $\ce{ CO }$ and $\ce{ C }$ can be produced alongside water
