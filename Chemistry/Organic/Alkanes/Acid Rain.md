Burning fossil fuels that have sulfur impurities can release sulfur dioxide, which contributes to acid rain. Acid rain causes damage to plants, kills fish and causes erosion of buildings
Some fossil fuels contain sulfur based imppurities. When burned, the sulfur reacts with oxygen, producing $\ce{ SO_{2} }$. Sulfur dioxide is an [[Brønsted–Lowry Acids|acidic]] gas. It reacts with water in the atmostphere to form sulfuric acid, which falls as acid rain. Nitrogen oxides do the same too
