Free [[Radicals|radical]] substitution reactions involve 3 main stages; initiation, propagation, and termination
## Initiation
Radicals are produced normally using visible or ultraviolet light. The type of reaction that produces them is called a photochemical reaction. The bond breaks, producing 2 radicals
## Propagation
When a radical reacts with a non-radical molecule. New radicals are created, which then go on to react with other non-radicals. This causes a chain reaction
## Termination
When 2 radicals react, they form a non-radical molecule. This ends the chain reaction
## General Reaction with [[Hydrocarbons]]
For a general hydrocarbon with a methyl group, $\ce{ RCH_{3} }$ reacting with a [[Halogens|halogen]], $\ce{ X }$, a free radical substitution can produce a [[Halogenoalkanes|halogenoalkane]]
### Initiation
Sunlight breaks the $\ce{ X-X }$ bond in a process called photodissociation. The bond breaks equally, producing 2 highly reactive radicals:
$$
\ce{ X_{2} -> X. +X. }
$$
### Propagation
$$
\ce{ X. + RCH_{3} -> HX +RCH_{2}. }
$$
$$
\ce{ RCH_{2}. +X_{2} -> RCH_{2}X +X. }
$$
### Termination
$$
\ce{ X. +X. -> X_{2} }
$$
$$
\ce{ X. +RCH_{2}. -> RCH_{2}X }
$$
$$
\ce{ RCH_{2}. +RCH_{2}. -> RCH_{2}CH_{2}R }
$$
If there are a significant number of $\ce{ X.  }$ radicals, we will get di, tri, and tetra haloalkanes etc, from multiple substitutions
