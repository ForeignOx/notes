[[Alkanes]] are found in crude oil, which is a mixture of different length [[Hydrocarbons]]. We can separate them using a technique called fractional [[distillation]]

Crude oil is vaporised using a furnace to about $350^{\circ}\pu{ C}$
The vaporised oil enters the column and rises through the trays. The longest hydrocarbons don't vaporise and run down to the bottom
The column has a temperature gradient. It is cooler at the top. As the vapour rises, parts of the mixture condense at different temperatures. This is because they are different chain lengths and hence have different strengths of [[Van der Waals forces]], hence different boiling points. The fractions are drawn off at diffferent levels. The shortest hydrocarbons won't even condense at $20^{\circ}\pu{ C}$
The fractions can be used in various ways:
- Gas is used in stoves
- Petrol is used in cars
- Kerosine is used as jet fuel and for heating
- Diesel Oil is used as diesel fuel
- Fuel Oil is used in ships and power stations
- Bitumen is used in roofing and tarmac
