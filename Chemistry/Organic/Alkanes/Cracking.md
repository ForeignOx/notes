Longer [[alkanes]] can be cracked to form smaller, more useful ones in the process of cracking. There are two types of cracking; thermal cracking and catalytic cracking
## Thermal Cracking
Is performed at a high temperature and pressure, circa $1000^{\circ}\pu{ C}$ and $\ce{ 70\pu{ atm} }$ of pressure. The products of thermal cracking are mainly alkenes
## Catalytic Cracking
High temperature and slight pressure used, circa $450^{\circ}\pu{ C}$. A zeolite catalyst is used, which helps to lower the temperature needed and so reduce the cost of the process. The products of catalytic cracking are mainly [[arenes|aromatic hydrocarbons]]
