Gas chromatography is useful to separate a mixture of liquids that are volatile and hence can be identified. In gas chromatography, you have a very thin column that is wound up inside an oven to save space. The column is lined with a solid or viscous liquid such as oil that acts as the stationary phase

The sample is injected into the machine and carried by an inert gas such as nitrogen, which is the moblie phase. Each substance takes a different amount of time to travel through the column and reach the detector. The length of time it takes is called the retention time. The retention time varies as some molecules spend more time stuck to the stationary phase and some spend more time travelling in the mobile phase
Gas chromatography spectra show peaks of varying sizes and appearing at different times. Each peak in the spectra represents a different substance with its own retention time. We can compare retention times with a library of known substance times to help identify substances in the mixture. The area under the peaks tells us the amount of each substance, the larger the area, the more substance
Gas chromatography is used to detect the amount of alcohol in urine and blood which can be used as evidence in court as the results are very reliable
Gas chromatography can also be used to identify volatile compounds in oil paints such as esters. This is useful for restoration experts of antique paintings
## Mass Spectrometry
We can combine gas chromatography and mass spectrometry together to help identify a mixture of substances. [[Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry|Mass spectrometry]] is better suited to identifying unknown compounds via their mass to charge ratio. However, when analysing a mixture of compounds, this can produce a confusing spectrum. Gas chromatography is not very good at identifying unknown compounds, but is verygood at separating a mixture of substances. Combining the two together allows us to use the benefits of both to produce a powerful analytical tool for chemists. The mixture of substances is fed through the gas chromatography machine and this separates them out. However, instead of putting them into a detector, it feedcs them through a mass spectrometer. The separated compounds run through the mass spectrometry machine, which produces spectra to identify the individual substances. The substances can then be positively identified as the mass spectra produced are compared with a library of spectra stored on a computer. This makes this process very efficient
