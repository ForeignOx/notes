Thin layer chromatography, or TLC, uses a stationary phase of silica or aluina mounted on a glass/metal plate. A pencil baseline is drawn and drops of the substance that you are separating are added. Place the plate in a solvent, the baseline must be above the solvent level

Usually a lid is added to prevent the solvent from evaporating. Leave until the solvent has moved up to near the top of the plate. Remove, mark the solvent front and allow drying
Some substance being separated may not dissolve as much and will stick to the stationary phase quickly. This creates a chromatogram. The $R_{f}$ values of the substances can be calculated as so:
$$
R_{f}=\frac{\text{Distance travelled by spot}}{\text{Distance travelled by solvent}}
$$
The number of spots on the plate tells you how many chemicals make up the mixture. $R_{f}$ values are fixed for each chemical, however, this changes if the temperature, solvent or make up of the TLC plate changes

## Amino Acids
Thin layer chromatography allows us to separate and identify [[amino acids]] as they have different solubilities. We can identify the amino acids using the positions on the chromatogram and their $R_{f}$ values. Amino acids are colourless compounds, however, they can be seen using iodine/ninhydrin solution or fluorescent dyes and UV light
