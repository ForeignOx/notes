A burette or other glass column is packed with silica or alumina which make up the stationary phase. The mixture and solvent is run through the column. The solvent is run through continuously. The different compounds in the mixture run through the column at different rates. This means they come out the bottom of the column at different times. As you have separated the chemicals, you now have pure chemicals
