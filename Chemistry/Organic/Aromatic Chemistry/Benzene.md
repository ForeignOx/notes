Benzene is a cyclic, planar molecule with the formula $\ce{ C_{6}H_{6} }$ and [[skeletal formula]]:
```smiles
c1ccccc1
```
Each carbon has 4 valent electrons. Each carbon is bonded to 2 other carbons and 1 hydrogen atom. The final lone electron is in a p-orbital which sticks out above and below the planar ring

The lone electrons in the p-orbitals combine to form a delocalised ring of electrons

Due to the delocalised electron structure, all the $\ce{ C-C }$ bonds in the molecule are the same. They have the same bond length of $139\pu{ pm}$, this is inbetween the standard single bond, which has length $154\pu{ pm}$ and double bond, which has length $134\pu{ pm}$
## Kekule's Structure
This is a structure that shows benzene with alternating double bonds, which we know is not really true, but looks like this:

C1=CC=CC=C1

## Benzene stability
Benzene is actually more stable than the theoretical alternative cyclohexa-1,3,5-triene (Kekule's model). We measure the stability of benzene by comparing the [[enthalpy]] change of hydrogenation in benzene and cyclohexa-1,3,5-triene
If we hydrogenate cyclohexene, it has an enthalpy change of $-120\pu{ kJ mol-1}$. Cyclohexene has 1 double bond. We extrapolate from this, that if it had 3 double bonds, it should take three times the amount of energy, so we predict the enthalpy of hydrogenation of cyclohexa-1,3,5-triene to be $-360\pu{ kJ mol-1}$
However, when we measure the enthalpy change of hydrogenation for benzene, it is far lower at $-208\pu{ kJ mol-1}$. This is the experimental value. Energy is required to break bonds, and energy is released to form bonds. This suggests more energy is required to break bonds in benzene than cyclohexa-1,3,5-triene. This suggestws that benzene is more stable than the theoretical cyclohexa-1,3,5-triene. This stability is due to the delocalised electron structure
