Nitrating [[Benzene]] is useful as it allows us to make dies for clothing and explosives. If we heat benzene with concentrated nitric acid ($\ce{ HNO_{3} }$) and sulfuric acid ($\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} }$), we form nitrobenzene. However, we need to make an [[Electrophiles|electrophile]]. The first step is to react the sulfuric acid with the nitric acid:
$$
\ce{ HNO_{3} +H_{2}SO_{4} -> H_{2}NO_{3}+ + HSO_{4}- }
$$
 Then the $\ce{ H_{2}NO_{3}+ }$ decomposes to form the electrophile, the nitronium [[Ions|ion]]:
 $$
\ce{ H_{2}NO_{3}+ -> NO_{2}+ +H_{2}O }
$$
We now use the nitronium ion ($\ce{ NO_{2}+ }$) and react with benzene to produce nitrobenzene in an [[Electrophilic Substitution]]

You have to be careful to keep this at a low temperature, otherwise multiple nitrations will occur. The $\ce{ H+ }$ joins the $\ce{ HSO_{4}- }$ to remake the [[Catalyst]]
Nitrobenzene compounds can be reduced to aromatic [[Amines]] which are used as dyes and pharmaceuticals
They can also be used to make explosives such as trinitromethylbenzene also known as trinitrotoluene (TNT)
