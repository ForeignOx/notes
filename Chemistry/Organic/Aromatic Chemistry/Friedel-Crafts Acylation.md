[[Benzene]] is widely used in pharmaceuticals and dye stuffs, however, due to the stability of benzene, it is difficult to react. Friedel-Crafts acylation can help to solve this problem. This is a reaction where an acyl group ($\ce{ RCO - }$) added to a benzene molecule. After the acyl group is added, the benzene structure is weaker and it mades it easier to modify it further to make useful products. In order to add onto the banzene ring, the [[Electrophiles|electrophile]] must have a very strong positive charge. Acyl groups have a positive charge, but it is not enough. We use a [[halogens|halogen]] carrier to act as a [[catalyst]] such as $\ce{ AlCl_{3} }$ which will produce a much stronger electrophile with a stronger positive charge
In the Friedel-Crafts acylation, we have to react an [[Acyl Chlorides|acyl chloride]] with the halogen carrier ($\ce{ AlCl_{3} }$) to make a strongly positive electrophile:
$$
\ce{ RCOCl +AlCl_{3} -> RCO+ +AlCl_{4}- }
$$
Once we have an electrophile, we need to react it with benzene to make a less stable phenylketone under [[reflux]] and a dry ether solvent in a [[nucleophilic substitution]]
