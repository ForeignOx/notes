Optical isomerism is a form of [[Stereoisomerism]], they have the same structural formula, but different arrangements of atoms in space, typically different arrangements of groups attached a central atom
## Organic Molecules
Optical isomers with carbon as a central molecule are mirror images of each other and have a chiral carbon atom. Chiral molecules have 4 different groups attached to a carbon atom. We can arrange these groups in 2 different ways, which forms 2 different molecules. We call these enantiomers

Optically active isomers will rotate [[Polarisation|plane polarised light]]. This is a method of detecting an optically active compound. One enantiomer will rotate light clockwise, the other will rotate it anticlockwise. They will each rotate it by the same amount. When we have an equal amount of each enantiomer, we have a racemic mixture. Racemic mixtures don't rotate plane polarised light, as the two enantiomers rotate light in opposite directions and cancel out
