Filtration is used to separate solids from liquids

A vacuum is used to help separate the liquid and solid components thoroughly. Place a filter paper disc in the Büchner funnel and dampen slightly to make a seal. Pour the reaction mixture into the Büchner funnel with the vacuum line on. The vacuum creates a reduced pressure in the flask and pulls the liquid through. The solid will be left in the Büchner funnel. A solid can be [[Recrystallisation|recrystallised]] to purify further
