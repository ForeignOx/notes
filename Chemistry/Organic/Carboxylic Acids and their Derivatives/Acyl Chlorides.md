Acyl Chlorides (also known as [[Brønsted–Lowry Acids|acid]] chlorides) have the functional group $\ce{ -COCl }$ which contains the acyl group ($\ce{ COCl }$). They are very similar to [[carboxylic acids]], but with a Chlorine replacing the hydroxyl group
The smallest acyl chlorides are methanoyl chloride, ethanoyl chloride, propanoyl chloride and butanoyl chloride

## [[Nucleophilic Addition-Elimination]] Reactions
These reactions are vigorous and produce white misty fumes of $\ce{ HCl }$ gas
## Reaction with Water
When you react an acyl chloride with water, you produce a carboxylic acid

### Reaction with Ammonia
When you react an acyl chloride with water, you produce an [[Amides|amide]]

### Reaction with Alcohol
When you react an acyl chloride with an [[alcohols|alcohol]], you produce an [[esters|ester]]

## Reaction with Primary Amine
When you react an acyl chloride with an [[Amines|amine]], you produce an [[Amides|N-Substituted Amides|N-substitued amide]]
