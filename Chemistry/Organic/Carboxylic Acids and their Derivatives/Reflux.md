Reflux is a technique used when you want to heat volatile liquids as volatile compounds evaporate and condense and fall back into the flask

The Liebig condenser has cold water running through the wall. When hot evaporating substances hit the colder condenser, they turn back into a liquid and return back to the round-bottomed flask to react further
As we are using flammable liquids, heating is done using a water bath or electric heater called a mantle. This is safer than using a naked flame
