Distillation is used when we want to separate substances with different boiling points.

Gently heating a mixture will result in the compounds separating out in order of boiling point. Knowing the boiling point of the chemical you want to separate will allow you to decide how you are going to separate your compound
If your compound has a lower boiling point than your starting mixture, you heat to the temperature of the boiling point of the compound you want to separate. Collect your product in the separate vessel
If your compound has a higher boiling point than your starting mixture, you heat to the temperature of the boiling point of your compound you want to separate. Your compound will remain in the round bottomed flask
Distillation is useful when you want to extract a chemical before it reacts any further. For example, [[redox|oxidising]] primary [[alcohols]] can produce [[aldehydes]], however, if the aldehydeisn't removed as soon as it is formed, it will oxidise to a [[Carboxylic Acids|carboxylic acid]]. Distillation is used to remove the aldehyde
