Despite [[distillation]] being able to separate most imurities, further separation and purification may be needed. A separation funnel can help and addition of a drying agent afterwards can be used

Separation involves adding products into a separating funnes and adding water to dissolve soluble impurities and create an aqueous solution. After allowing the solution to settle, 2 layers will form:
- Top layer - impure product
- Bottom layer - aqueous layer containing water-soluble impurities
Drain the aqueous layer off for further [[purification]]
