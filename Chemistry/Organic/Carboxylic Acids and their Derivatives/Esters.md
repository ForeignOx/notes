Esters are [[Carboxylic Acids]] which instead of having a hydroxyl group, the hydrogen is replaced with another organic goup

## Uses
Esters are used commercially and in industrial processes:
- They are used in perfumes and food flavourings as some esters have sweet smells such as that of pear drops; this makes them ideal in fragrances and food products
- They are used in solvents as esters are polar, so other polar compounds will dissolve readily in esters. They also have low boiling points and evaporate easily, making them valuable to make glues
- They are used to make plastics more flexible during the polymerisation process. They can leach out of the plastic over time however, so the plastic does become more brittle eventually
## Ester Hydrolysis
Esters can be hydrolysed (split using water) naturally, however, the process can be sped up using an [[Brønsted–Lowry Acids|acid]] (acid hydrolysis) or a [[Brønsted–Lowry Bases|base]] (base hydrolysis)
### Acid Hydrolysis
Here we use a dilute acid to split an ester into a carboxylic acid and an [[Alcohols|alcohol]]. We can use sulfuric or hydrochloric acid and the reaction is conducted under [[Reflux]]
$$
\ce{R_{1}COOR_{2} +H_{2}O <=>[H^+] R_{1}COOH +R_{2}OH  }
$$
### Base Hydrolysis
Here we use a dilute base to split an ester into a carboxylate [[Ions|ion]] and an alcohol. We can use sodium hydroxide and the reaction is conducted under reflux
$$
\ce{ R_{1}COOR_{2} +OH- <=> R_{1}COO- + R_{2}OH }
$$
