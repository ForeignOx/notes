When [[alcohols|glycerol]] and [[Carboxylic Acids|fatty acids]] react, we produce an [[Esters|ester]] which makes fats and oils. Glycerol, also known as propane-1,2,3-triol is reacted with long chain fatty acids which can be [[Saturated Compounds|saturated]] or unsaturated

## Vegetable Oils
Vegetable oils have unsaturated [[Hydrocarbons|hydrocarbon]] chains that are not straight, which means the chains can't pack together closely and hence have lower [[Van der Waals forces]] and hence lower melting points and so are liquids at room temperature 
## Animal Fats
Fat is an ester which have saturated hydrocarbon chains that are straight and more uniform than oils which means the chains can pack together closely and hence have much higher Van der Waals forces. They have higher melting points and are solids at room temperature
