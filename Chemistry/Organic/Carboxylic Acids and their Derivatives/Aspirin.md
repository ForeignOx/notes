Aspirin is an [[esters|ester]] made by reacting [[Acid Anhydrides|ethanoic anhydride]] or [[Acyl Chlorides|ethanoyl chloride]] with salicylic acid. Ethanoic anhydride is used instead of ethanoyl chloride in industry because it is safer as it is less corrosive, it doesn't produce harmful $\ce{ HCl }$ gas, and it doesn't react vigorously with water. It is also cheaper
The reaction to produce it is a [[nucleophilic addition-elimination]] reaction and the overall reaction is shown below:
