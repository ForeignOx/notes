Recrystallisation is a method to purify solids. The solvent chosen is very important
1. Add just enough hot solvent to allow the impure solid to dissolve. This will mean you have a saturated solution of your impure product
2. Allow the solution to cool down slowly such that crystals start to form
3. Your impurities will remain dissolved in solution as there is a smaller quantity of them, it takes a lot longer for them to crystallise
4. [[Filtration|Filter]] to get your solid purified crystals. Wash with very cold solvent and dry them off
You have to select your solvent carefully as you want your impure solid to dissolve fully in hot solvent but be virtually insoluble when it is cold. If not, your substance won't dissolve in hot solvent, and you can't filter the purified solid if it is soluble in cold solvent
