Carboxylic acids have the carboxyl ($\ce{ -COOH }$) functional group which contians both a carbonyl group ($\ce{ C=O }$) and a hydroxyl group ($\ce{ -OH }$)
The smallest carboxylic acids are methanoic acid, ethanoic acid, propanoic acid and butanoic acid:

c(=O)(-O)
cc(=O)(-O)
ccc(=O)(-O)
cccc(=O)(-O)
```
Carboxylic acids are [[weak acids]] which means they dissociate partially to form a carboxylate [[ions|ion]] and a $\ce{ H+ }$ ion:
$$
\ce{ RCOOH <<=> RCOO- +H+ }
$$
## Reaction with Carbonates
As they are acids, they react with carbonates to form salt, carbon dioxide and water
This is the reaction with sodium carbonate:
$$
\ce{ 2RCOOH_{\text{(aq)}} +Na_{2}CO_{3}_{\text{(s)}} -> 2RCOONa_{\text{(aq)}} +H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} +CO_{2}_{\text{(g)}} }
$$
This is the reaction with sodium hydrogen carbonate:
$$
\ce{ RCOOH_{\text{(aq)}} +NaHCO_{3}_{\text{(s)}} -> RCOONa_{\text{(aq)}} +H_{2}O_{\text{(l)}} +CO_{2}_{\text{(g)}} }
$$
## Esterification
An [[Esters|ester]] is produced when carboxylic acids react with [[alcohols]] with an [[Brønsted–Lowry Acids|acidic]] catalyst, such as sulfuric acid
