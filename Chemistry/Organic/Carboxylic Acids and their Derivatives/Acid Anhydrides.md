Acid anhydrides are molecules that are made from 2 [[carboxylic acids]] bonded together by the hydroxyl groups like so:

## [[Nucleophilic Addition-Elimination]] Reactions
These reactions are very similar to [[acyl chlorides]], but they are less vigorous. These reactions always produce a carboxylic acid
### Reaction with Water
When acid anhydrides react with water, they produce two identical carboxylic acids

### Reaction with Ammonia
When acid anhydrides react with ammonia, they produce carboxylic acids and [[Amides]]

### Reaction with [[alcohols|Alcohol]]
When acid anhydrides react with alcohols, they produce carboxylic acids and [[esters]]

### Reaction with Primary [[Amines]]
When acid anhydrides react with primary amines, they produce carboxylic acids and [[Amides|N-Substituted Amides]]
