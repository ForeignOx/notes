The purity of a solid compound can be determined by measuring the melting point
![[Pasted image 20240509212045.png]]
1. Add a sample of the solid product into a capillary tube and place into the heating element of the melting point apparatus
2. The machine will slowly increase the temperature until the substance starts to melt
3. There is a temperature range from when the solid just starts to melt to when it fully melts
4. Compare the melting point against data book values
5. If your substance contians impurities, the melting point will be lower, and the temperature range the substance melts at will be larger
