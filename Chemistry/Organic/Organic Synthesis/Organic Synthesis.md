Chemists use organic synthesis to make drugs, however they are looking to make them cost-effective, safe and have minimal environmental impact
Chemists try to use starting materials that are safe and have low toxicity levels to living things
Reactions that have a high [[Atom Economy]] and high percentage yield are preferred. Synthetic processes that have fewer steps generally produce less waste and are more efficient
Solvents are sometimes used in chemical reactions, however, they are often flammable and toxic and increase waste. Chemists try to develop synthetic routes where solvents are not used or minimised
