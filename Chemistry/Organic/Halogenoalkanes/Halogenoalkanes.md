Halogenoalkanes are [[Alkanes]] with 1 or more [[Halogens]] attached, commonly abbreviated to haloalkanes
An example is 1-chloropropane:
```smiles
Clccc
```
## Bond Polarity and Nucleophilic Substitution
Halogenoakanes have a [[Polar Bonds|polar bond]] and are attacked by [[Nucleophiles]]. This is because halogens are more [[Electronegativity|electronegative]] than carbon, so they pull electrons towards themselves in a [[Covalent bond]]. This is what leads to the polar bond, which allows them to be attacked by nucleophiles. This process is [[Nucleophilic Substitution]]

### Reaction with Hydroxide [[Ions]]
Halogenoalkanes react with hydroxide ions to form [[Alcohols]] in warm aqueous solutions of a hydroxide source, such as $\ce{ NaOH }$ under [[Reflux]]. This is the mechanism:

### Reaction with Cyanide Ions
Halogenoalkanes react with cyanide ions to form [[Nitriles]] in warm alcoholic solutions of a cyanide source, such as ethanolic potassium cyanide under reflux. This is the mechanism:

### Reaction with Ammonia
Halogenoalkanes also react with ammonia to produce [[Amines]]. The conditions are that the haloalkane must be heated with alcaholic ammonia, with excess ammonia

## [[Elimination]] with Hydroxide Ions
Halogenoalkanes react with hydroxide ions via elimination using an alcohol solvent to form [[Alkenes]]. The conditions for this are alcoholic sources of hydroxide ions, such as an ethanol solvent with sodium hydroxide, carried out under reflux at high temperatures

## Boiling Point Trends of Halogenoalkanes
The strength of the [[Intermolecular Forces]] govern the boiling point. The stronger the intermolecular bond, the higher the boiling point. As you go down group 7, the number of electrons in the halogen atoms increases. More electrons mean stronger [[Van der Waals Forces]] between the molecules, and so more [[energy]] is needed to overcome these forces. This leads to the boiling points increasing as we go down the group

## Halogenoalkane Reactivity
[[Mean Bond Enthalpy|Bond enthalpy]] determines the reactivity of haloakanes, not the bond polarity. The table below shows bond enthalpies of a $\ce{ C-X }$ bond. The $\ce{ C-I }$ bond has the lowest bond enthalpy and is easiest to break. This means reactions with $\ce{ C-I }$ bonds are more likely to occur

| Bond Type     | Bond Enthaly ($\pu{ kJ mol-1}$) |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| $\ce{ C-F }$  | 485                             |
| $\ce{ C-Cl }$ | 327                             |
| $\ce{ C-Br }$ | 285                             |
| $\ce{ C-I }$  | 213                             |
