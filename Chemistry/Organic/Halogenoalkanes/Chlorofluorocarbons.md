Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are [[hydrocarbons]] that have had all their hydrogens replaced by chlorine and fluorine. They are stable molecules but are broken down by [[Electromagnetic Radiation|UV light]]. $\ce{ C-Cl }$ bonds are broken down by UV radiation in the atmosphere. [[Radicals]] are formed that catalyse the break-down of ozone. $\ce{ C-Cl }$ bonds are broken easiest by UV, as they have the lowest [[Mean Bond Enthalpy|bond enthalpy]]. A $\ce{ C-F }$ fond is less likely to be broken as it is stronger
The breaking down of ozone happens in these steps:
## Initiation
Sunlight breaks the $\ce{ C-Cl }$ bond in a CFC molecule and produces 2 radicals which will react with ozone molecules:
$$
\ce{ RCCl +\gamma -> RC. +Cl. }
$$
## Propagation
$$
\ce{ Cl. +O_{3} -> O_{2} +ClO. }
$$
$$
\ce{ ClO. +O_{3} -> 2O_{2} +Cl. }
$$
## Termination
$$
\ce{ Cl. +Cl. -> Cl_{2}}
$$
## Overall Reaction
$$
\ce{ 2O_{3}-> 3O_{2} }
$$
## Restricting use of CFCs
CFCs are stable, unreactive, non-toxic chemicals that were used in refrigerators as a refrigerant, and as a propellant in deodorants. It was demonstrated by scientists that CFCs were damaging the ozone layer. Despite the advantages, the risks outweigh the benefits - ozone absorbs most harmful UV radiation that causes skin cancer. We now use hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) as they don't have chlorine in
