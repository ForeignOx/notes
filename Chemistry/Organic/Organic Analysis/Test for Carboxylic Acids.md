[[Carboxylic Acids]] can be identified when reacted with carbonates. This is because carboxylic acids react with carbonates to make carbon dioxide gas and water:
$$
\ce{ CO_{3}^2- +2H+ -> CO_{2} +H_{2}O }
$$
When the $\ce{ CO_{2} }$ is bubbled through limewater, it turns cloudy. A suitable carbonate to use would be solid sodium carbonate or even sodium carbonate solution. One must be careful as any other [[Brønsted–Lowry Acids|acid]] will react in the same way, so you have to be sure that you don't have any other acid before you can draw conclusions
