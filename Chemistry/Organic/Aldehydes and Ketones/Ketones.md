Ketones are organic molecules that have the carbonyl functional group ($\ce{ C=O }$) on a carbon that is attached to two other carbons
## Oxidation of Ketones
Ketones can't be oxidised. This is useful as it allows you to distinguish them with [[aldehydes]] which can be oxidised
## Reduction of Ketones
Ketones can be reduced to form secondary [[alcohols]]. [[Reducing agents]] such as $\ce{ NaBH_{4} }$ or sodium tetrahydridoborate dissolved in methanol and water can be used for this:
$$
\ce{ RCOR ->[2\text{[H]}] RCHOHR }
$$
This is a [[nucleophilic addition]] reaction

If an unsymmetrical ketone is used, then a mixture of [[Optical Isomerism|enantiomers]] is produced
## Nucleophilic Addition of Cyanide [[Ions]]
[[Potassium cyanide]] reacts with ketones to produce a hydroxynitrile by nucleophilic addition (in acid solution) in a nucleophilic addition reaction
$$
\ce{ R_{1}COR_{2}_{\text{(aq)}} +KCN_{\text{(aq)}} +H+_{\text{(aq)}} -> R_{1}C(OH)(CN)R_{2}_{\text{(aq)}} +K+_{\text{(aq)}} }
$$

Hydrogen cyanide can also be used and reacts in the same way, but no acid is required. $\ce{ HCN }$ is more dangerous, however. If an unsymmetrical ketone is used, then a mixture of enantiomers is produced
