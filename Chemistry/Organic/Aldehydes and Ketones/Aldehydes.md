Aldehydes are organic molecules that have the carbonyl functional group ($\ce{ C=O }$) on a carbon that is attached to only one other carbon
The 4 smallest aldehydes are methanal, ethanal, propanal, and butanal:

c=O
cc=O
ccc=O
cccc=O

## Oxidation of Aldehydes
Aldehydes can be readily [[Redox|oxidised]] to [[carboxylic acids]] using an [[Oxidising Agents|oxidising agent]]
$$
\ce{ RCHO ->[ \text{[O]} ] RCOOH }
$$
## Reduction of Aldehydes
Aldehydes can be reduced to form primary [[alcohols]]. [[Reducing agents]] such as $\ce{ NaBH_{4} }$ or sodium tetrahydridoborate dissolved in methanol and water can be used for this:
$$
\ce{ RCHO ->[2\text{[H]}] RCH_{2}OH }
$$

## Nucleophilic Addition of Cyanide [[Ions]]
[[Potassium cyanide]] reacts with aldehydes to produce a hydroxynitrile by nucleophilic addition (in acid solution) in a nucleophilic addition reaction
$$
\ce{ RCHO_{\text{(aq)}} +KCN_{\text{(aq)}} +H^+_{\text{(aq)}} -> RCH(OH)CN_{\text{(aq)}} +K+_{\text{(aq)}} }
$$

Hydrogen cyanide can also be used and reacts in the same way, but no acid is required. $\ce{ HCN }$ is more dangerous, however. If an unsymmetrical aldehyde is used, then a mixture of [[Optical Isomerism|enantiomers]] is produced
