A chemical mechanism shows the movement of electrons during a chemical reaction. We use curly arrows to show the movement of a pair of electrons. They always start from an area which electrons, such as a bond or lone pair. Free radical mechanisms don't require curly arrows. THey end where you are moving the electrons to, or in the formation of a [[covalent bond]]
