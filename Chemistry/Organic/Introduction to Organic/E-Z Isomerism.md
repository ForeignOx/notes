E/Z [[isomerism]] is a form of [[stereoisomerism]]. A common form of it involves a $\ce{ C=C }$ bond. This is because atoms can't rotate around the $\ce{ C=C }$ bond, as it is rigid, this means that there can be multiple ways of showing the same molecule, but one section is rotated compared to the other in space
An example of this is the distinction between $\ce{ Z-CH_{3}CH_{2}CHCHCH_{3} }$ and $\ce{ E-CH_{3}\mathbb{C}H_{2}CHCHCH_{3} }$:
```smiles
cc\c=c/c
cc/c=c/c
```
You only get E/Z isomerism when you hae 2 different atoms or groups of atoms on the same carbon of the $\ce{ C=C }$ bond
E stands for Entgagen (opposite) which is when 'heaviest' groups are on opposite sides of the double bond
Z stands for Zusammen (together) which is when 'heaviest' goups are on the same sides of the double bond
The exact definitions for what are the heaviest groups are given by the Cahn Ingold Prelog rules
## Cahn Ingold Prelog Rules
Start by considering one side of the $\ce{ C=C }$ bond, calculate the atomic numbers of the first elements directly bonded to that carbon. The atom with the highest atomic number is given a higher priority and is considered 'heavier'. If it is a tie, check the next heaviest atom bonded to the atom involved in the tie and repeat
