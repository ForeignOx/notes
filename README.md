### Reading time
These are my notes that I have taken for AQA chemistry and EDUQAS physics A levels, as well as some random maths stuff I did along the way. Obsidian is pretty good at sorting everything so hopefully it's pretty self-explanatory. The project is a work in progress and I sort of rushed out all of these notes in 2 months, so there may well be issues, but I aim to continue updating them every now and then. \\
I am going to be starting my maths degree next year and will continue taking notes here for all to enjoy, so look out for that! I will also take notes on various sciency books I read when I have some time, so there's that too.\\
A nifty feature of obsidian that people can use it the plugin that converts notes to anki flashcards, feel free to install and do that, anki is an amazing way to revise stuff.\\
I wrote the physics notes by going through the two eduqas textbooks (for years 1 and 2), so the physics notes essentially have the whole textbook. It also has some maths in there as at A level calculus is banned in physics for some reason :/ \\
I wrote the chemistry notes by going through the Allery Chemistry videos for AQA, which aren't perfect in all honesty, but are still great for revision, so check the guy out: https://www.youtube.com/@AlleryChemistry \\
