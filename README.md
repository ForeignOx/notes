## What's all this then?
These are my personal academic notes on all variety of things focusing particularly on mathematics with brief excursions into A level physics and chemistry. I am an undergraduate at Durham University who has completed 1 year of a maths degree and these are my obsidian notes for that process for people to gaze upon.
Things will not be absolutely perfect as these notes are usually written during the rush of a lecture. Despite this I do aim to go about things in a fairly rigorous manner and will attempt to include as many proofs as I am able to do (some of which may contain errors however; I am not perfect and many proofs will be my own)
Most of my inspiration will come from various books and textbooks and lecture notes for my course but will be trying to keep it original (except standard definitions/proofs) to avoid plagiarising...
