A proposition is a statement which has a truth value. It is either true or false. Questions are not statements and are thus not propositions
Often propositions depend on a variable $x$. This is called a conditional statement $A(x)$. We can turn a conditional statement into an unconditional statement using the quantifiers "for all" ($\forall$) and "there exists" ($\exists$)
