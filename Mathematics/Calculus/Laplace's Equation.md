Laplace's equation is a [[Second Order Partial Differential Equations|second order]] [[Linear Partial Differential Equations|linear PDE]] of the form:
$$
u_{x x}+u_{yy}=0
$$
So $A=C=1,B=0$, so
$$
M=\begin{pmatrix}
1&0\\0&1
\end{pmatrix},\det(M)=1>0
$$
If we have some shape in three dimensional space, the minimal surface is described by Laplace's Equation. For example soap bubbles do this on a wire
