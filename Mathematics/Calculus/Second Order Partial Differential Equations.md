## [[Linear Partial Differential Equations|Linear]] PDEs of Two Variables
If we have some function $u(x,t)$, then we have a general partial differential equation:
$$
Au_{xx}+2Bu_{xt}+Cu_{tt}+Du_{x}+Eu_{t}+Fu=0
$$
Where $A,B,C,D,E,F$ could depend on $x,t$
PDEs are classified according to the sign of
$$
\det(M),M=\begin{pmatrix}
A&B\\B&C
\end{pmatrix}
$$
### Hyperbolic PDE
If $\det(M)<0$, then the PDE is hyperbolic. An equation of this is the [[Wave Equation|Wave equation]]
These describe propagation along lines
