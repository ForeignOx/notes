A differential equation (DE), is an equation which relates an unknown [[Functions|function]] to one or more of its [[Differentiation|derivatives]]
The order of a differential equation is the order of the highest derivative which appears in the equation
Solving a differential equation is the process of finding a function (known as the solution) that satisfies the differential equation
When the function appearing in the equation depends only on a single variable, say $y(x)$, then we say the differential equation is ordinary (ODE), we say $y(x)$ is the dependent variable in the ODE, and $x$ is the independent variable, so solving the ODE means finding $y(x)$
