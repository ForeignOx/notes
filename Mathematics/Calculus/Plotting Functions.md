## $1$ Variable
Start by setting up $\hspace{0pt}2$ sets of axes, one representing the variable, the other where the variable maps to
The plot of $f$ (where $f$ is a real valued [[Functions|function]] of a single real variable) is the set of all points $(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2$ such that $x\in \text{Dom}f$, $y=f(x)$
To sketch $f$, we often just restrict the domain to an [[Intervals|interval]], we often pick a region such that the graph shows significant features like turning points and intercepts
When necessary, we use a closed shaded circle to indicate an included point, and an open unshaded circle to indicate an excluded point
The graph of a function is a curve, but not every curve is the graph of a function
The plot of the function is a $\hspace{0pt}1$ dimensional surface embedded in the two dimensions
### The vertical line test
If any vertical line intersects the curve more than once, then the curve is not the graph of a function
### Implicit Plots
Say we have a function defined implicitely, we can plot them by essentially putting a dot at any point where the function is consistent, so if you have some 
$$
C=\{ (x,y):g(x,y)=0 \}
$$
That would be all the points where the function $g(x,y)$ are $\hspace{0pt}0$, which will still only require $\hspace{0pt}2$ axes.
## $\hspace{0pt}2$ Variables
You can plot a $\hspace{0pt}2$ variable function $z=f(x,y)$ as a two dimensional surface $S$ embedded in three dimensions by setting up three perpendicular axes. Since $f(x,y)$ is well defined for $x,y$, it must pass the 'vertical line' test
### Contour
We can also represent functions of $\hspace{0pt}2$ variables by contour plot by plotting lines $f(x,y)=c$ for various values of constant $c$
## Implicit Plots in Higher Dimensions
We can also define functions of two or more variablees implicitely by adding a variable to form a function, for example $g(x,y,z)$, so we can plot all points on the curve satisfying:
$$
S=\{ (x,y,z):g(x,y,z)=0 \}
$$
For $n$ variables we can say $x_{n+1}=f(x_{2},x_{2},\dots,x_{n})$ as defining an $n$-dimensional surface embedded in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ parametrically:
$$
(x_{1},x_{2},\dots,x_{n},x_{n+1})=(x_{1},x_{2},\dots,x_{n},f(x_{1},x_{2},\dots,x_{n}))
$$
