Lots of quantities which depend on more than one variable evolve according to some PDE, such as the heat equation
Linear partial differential equations still follow the [[Principle of Superposition|principle of superposition]] since they are [[linear|linear]]; i.e. if $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$ are solutions, then $\alpha y_{1}+\beta y_{2}$ is a solution, so the solution space is a [[Vectorspaces|vectorspace]], but in this case, infinite [[Dimension|dimensional]] (unlike with [[Linear Ordinary Differential Equations|linear ordinary differential equations]])
