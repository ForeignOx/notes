If we are looking for an [[Orthonormal Vectors|orthonormal]] [[Basis|basis]] of $\mathbb{R}[x]_{n}$ with respect to the [[Inner Product|inner product]]
$$
(p,q)=\int ^{\infty}_{-\infty} e^{ -x^{2} } p(x)q(x) \, dx
$$
Using [[Gram-Schmidt Procedure|Gram-Schmidt]], we can find the polynomials that satisfy this, and these are known as Hermite polynomials
These have a [[Self-Adjoint|self-adjoint]] [[Linear Maps|linear operator]] associated with it:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{H}f=f''-2xf'
$$
