A point $x_{0}$ is called a regular point of a [[Linear Ordinary Differential Equations|linear ODE]] if the functions $p_{1}(x),\dots,p_{n}(x)$ are [[Analytic Functions|analytic]] at $x_{0}$
If a point is not regular, it is singular
## [[Second Order Differential Equations|Second Order ODEs]]
For 
$$
y''+p(x)y'+q(x)y=0
$$
You have a regular point at $x=x_{0}$ if $p,q$ are analytic at $x=x_{0}$
You have a regular singular point $x_{0}$ if $p(x)(x-x_{0})$ and $q(x)(x-x_{0})^{2}$ are analytic at $x=x_{0}$
