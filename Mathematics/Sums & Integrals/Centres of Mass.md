Recall for point masses, $m_{1}, m_{2}, \dots, m_{n}$ along a light rod at distances $x_{1}, x_{2}, \dots, x_{n}$ we calculate the centre of mass using moments:
![[Centres of Mass 2024-02-16 12.40.52.excalidraw]]
Which can be calculated as
$$
m_{1}gx_{1}+m_{2}gx_{2}+\dots+m_{n}gx_{n}=(m_{1}+m_{2}+\dots+m_{n})\bar{x}
$$
$$
\implies \sum(m_{i}x _{i})=\bar{x}\sum m_{i}
$$
