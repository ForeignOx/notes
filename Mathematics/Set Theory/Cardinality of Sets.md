If $S$ is a finite [[Sets|set]], its size or cardinality denoted by $|S|$, is the number of elements it contains. Fro example, $|\{ 1,3,5,7,9 \}|=5$ and [[Empty Set|$\mid\emptyset\mid=0$]] 
If $|S|=m$, we can write $S$ as:
$$
S=\{ x_{1},x_{2},\dots,x_{m} \}
$$
This is a list or [[Sequences|sequence]] of length $m$
