The symbols $<,>,\leq,\geq$ are called inequalities
If $a$ and $b$ are [[Real Numbers|real numbers]], then $a$ is less than $b$, denoted $a<b$ if $b-a$ is a positive number. This is equivalent to saying that $b$ is greater than $a$, which is denoted $b>a$
Geometrically, $a<b$ if the point $a$ lies to the left of the point $b$ on a number line. The notation $a\leq b$ means that either $a<b$ or $a=b$ (equivalently $b\geq a$)
The real numers are ordered in the sense that if $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, then exactly one of the following holds: $a<b,a=b,a>b$
Inequalites satisfy the following properties:
- If $a<b$ and $b<c$, then $a<c$ (transitivity)
- If $a<b$, then $a+c<b+c$ for all real numbers $c$
- If $a<b$ and $c<d$, then $a+c<b+d$
- If $a<b$ and $c>0$, then $ac<bc$
- If $a<b$ and $c<0$, then $ac>bc$
A crucial point is the last property: if an inequality is multiplied by a negative quantity, then the "direction" of the inequality is reversed
To solve polynomial inequlities, an easy way of doing them is make the inequality compared to $\hspace{0pt}0$, then to factorise them into their roots and then depending on if it is an even or odd polynomial, and whether it is positive or negative, considering the regions that would be positive or negative. We can consider an expression of the form:
$$
(x-a_{1})^{k_{1}}(x-a_{2})^{k_{2}}\dots(x-a_{n})^{k_{n}}
$$
Where $k_{1},k_{2},\dots,k_{n}$ are positive integers and $a_{1}<a_{2}<\dots<a_{n}$. Such an expression is zero at $a_{1},a_{2},\dots a_{n}$. It is positive on those intervals where an even number of factors are negative, and it is negative on those intervals where an odd number of factors are negative.
For example, the expression $(x+2)(x-1)(x-3)$ is negative on $(-\infty,-2)$ as for these values of $x$, all three terms are negative, then positive on $(-2,1)$ as only $\hspace{0pt}2$ terms are negative, then negative on $(1,3)$ as one term is negative, then positive on $(3,\infty)$ as no terms are negative for these values of $x$
