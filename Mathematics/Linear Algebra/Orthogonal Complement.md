Let $U$ be a [[Subspaces|subspace]] of the [[Inner Product Spaces|inner product space]] on the [[Vectorspaces|vectorspace]] $V$ with [[Inner Product|inner prouct]] $(,)$, then the orthogonal complement of $U$ is
$$
U^{\bot}=\left\{ \underline{v}\in V\mid(\underline{u},\underline{v})=0\forall \underline{u}\in U \right\}
$$
$U^{\bot}$ is a subspace of $V$, if $V$ is finite [[Dimension|dimensional]], then we can use the [[Sums and Intersections of Vectorspaces#Direct Sums|direct sum]] to say:
$$
V=U\oplus U^{\bot}
$$
Furthermore, given any vector $\underline{v}\in V$ there is a unique vector $\underline{u}\in U$ called the orthogonal projection of $\underline{v}$ onto $U$
