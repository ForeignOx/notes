A system of [[Linear]] equations is a number of linear equations in a given number of variables
$$
a_{11}x_{1}+a_{12}x_{2}+\dots+a_{1n}x_{n}=b_{1}
$$
$$
a_{21}x_{1}+a_{22}x_{2}+\dots+a_{2n}x_{n}=b_{2}
$$
$$
\vdots
$$
$$
a_{n1}x_{1}+a_{n 2}x_{2}+\dots+a_{nn}x_{n}=b_{n}
$$
Is a system of linear equations
If the constants $b_{1},\dots,b_{n}$ are all 0, we call the system homogeneous, otherwise we call it inhomogenous
We solve systems of linear equations using [[Gauss-Jordan Elimination|Gauss-Jordan elimination]]
