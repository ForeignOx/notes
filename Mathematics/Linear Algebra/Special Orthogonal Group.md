The [[Subsets|subset]] of all the [[Orthogonal Matrices|orthogonal]] [[Matrices|matrices]] with [[Determinants|determinant]] $+1$ is known as the special [[Orthogonal Group|orthogonal group]], and is denoted by:
$$
SO(n):=\left\{ M\in O(n)|\det(M)=1 \right\}
$$
It turns out this is in fact the set of rotational matrices
