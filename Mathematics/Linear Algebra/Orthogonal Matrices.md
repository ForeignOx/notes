A real $n\times n$ [[Matrices|matrix]] is orthogonal if its [[Transpose|transpose]] is equal to its [[Matrix Inverses|inverse]] or:
$$
M^{\top}M=I
$$
$$
 \implies M^{-1}=M^{\top}
$$
Note, since $\det M^{\top}=\det M$, we have 
$$
1=\det(M^{-1}M)=\det(M^{\top}M)=\det M^{\top}\det M=(\det M)^{2}
$$
So if $M$ is orthogonal,
$$
\det M=\pm 1
$$
