A sequence of [[Random Variables|random variables]] $X_{1},X_{2},\dots$ are called [[Independence|independent]] and identically distributed (IID) if
- The random variables are independent
- The random variables are identically distributed; all $X_{i}$'s have the same distribution, that is $F_{X_{1}}(\cdot)=F_{X_{2}}(\cdot)=\dots$ 
If a sequence of random variables $X_{1},X_{2},\dots$ is IID , then [[E(X)|$E(X_{1})=E(X_{2})=\dots$]], and [[Var(X)|$Var(X_{1})=Var(X_{2})=\dots$]] 
This is because:
$$
E(X_{i})=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} xf(x) \, dx 
$$
For all $X_{i}$ as they have the same distribution, and for variance, the same type of thing applies
