A measure $\mu$ can be defined on any [[Sets|set]] $\Omega$ with a [[Sigma Algebra|$\sigma$-algebra]] of [[Subsets|subsets]] $\mathfrak{F}$, and the defining axioms are versoins of the axioms of [[Probabilities|probability]]. The special property of a measure is simply that $\mu(\Omega )=1$. Measure theory is the theory that gives mathematical foundation to the concepts of length, area, and volume. For example, on $\mathbb{R}$, the unique measure that has $\mu(a,b)=b-a$ for intervals $(a,b)$ is the Lebesgue measure
