Let $G=(V,E)$ be a [[Simple Graphs|simple]] [[Graphs|graph]]. Then the complement of $G$ is $\bar{G}=(V,F)$, where $F=\{ uv\in\mathbb{V}|uv\not\in E \}$
So $\bar{G}$ has all other edges
If you combine a graph and its complement, you get the [[Complete Graphs|complete graph]]: $K=(V,E\cup F)$ cc
## Example
When $G=(V,E)$ is the graph with vertex set $V:=\{ a,b,c,d \}$ and edge set $E:=\{ ac,ad,cd \}$, then the complement of $G$ is the graph $\bar{G}=(V,F)$, where $F:=\{ ab,bc,bd \}$:
