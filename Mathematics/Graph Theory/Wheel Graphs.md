The wheel [[Graphs|graph]] on $n$ vertices is called $W_{n}$. It can be constructed from the [[Star Graphs|star graph]] $S_{n}$ composed with a [[Cycle Graphs|cycle graph]] $C_{n}$; i.e. you add a [[Cycles|cycle]] of $n-1$ edges around the [[Leaves|leaves]] of $S_{n}$. $W_{n}$ has $\left| V \right|=n$ and $\left| E \right|=2(n-1)$
## Example
The wheel graph $W_{6}$
