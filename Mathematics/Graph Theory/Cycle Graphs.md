The cycle [[Graphs|graph]] on $n$ vertices is called $C_{n}$. Given $\left| V \right|=n$, the cycle graph is constructed by listing the vertices in some order as $v_{1},\dots,v_{n}$ and then adding the cycel of $n$ edges $v_{1}v_{2},v_{2}v_{3},\dots,v_{n-1}v_{n},v_{n}v_{1}$. So $C_{n}$ has $n$ vertices and $n$ edgs, and every vertex has [[Degree of Vertices|degree]] $2$
## Example
