Given a [[graphs|graph]] $G=(V,E,\phi)$, where there exist [[Subsets|subsets]] $V_{1},V_{2}\subset V$ such that $V_{1}\cup C_{2}=V$, $V_{1}\cap V_{2}=\emptyset$, and every edge of $G$ is of the form $uv$, where $u\in V_{1}$ and $v\in V_{2}$ (i.e. every edge has one end in $V_{1}$ and one in $V_{2}$), the $G$ is bipartite
