$\hspace{0pt}7$ bridges crossed the river and it was said that residents spent their sunday walks trying to solve the following problem:
    "Can one arrange a course in such a way as to pass over each ridge once and not more than once?"
One can use graph theory to model this question. Representing land by vertices and bridges by edges, we obtain the graph below:

Euler showed it could not be done, for one enters each vertex as often as one leaves it. So, in order to walk over each bridge just once, returning to the start, each vertex must have even degree
