Let $G=(V,E,\phi)$ be a finite [[Connectedness|connected]] [[Graphs|graph]] with $\left| V \right|>1$. Then $G$ has an [[Euler Circuits|Euler]] [[Trails#Circuits|circuit]] iff all vertices of $G$ have even [[Degree of Vertices|degree]]
## Lemma 
If a graph $G=(V,E,\phi)$ is finite and connected, with $\left| V \right|>1$ and all vertices of even degree, then $G$ is a finite union of edge-disjoint [[Paths#Cycle|cycles]] (where no two cycles $C_{1},C_{2}$ in $G$ having edge
