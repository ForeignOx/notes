Given a [[Graphs|graph]] $G=(V,E,\phi)$, the degree of a vertex $v\in V$ denoted $d_{G}(v)$, or simply $d(v)$ when there is no ambiguity concerning the graph $G$, the number of times that the vertex is an endpoint of an edge. More fomally, using the [[Indicator Function|indicator function]],
$$
d_{G}(v):=\sum_{e\in E}\mathbb{1}_{\{ v\in \phi(e) \}}
$$
For [[Simple Graphs|simple graphs]] (or any graphs with no loops), this is the same as the number of edges incident to the vertex
