A drawing of a [[Graphs|graph]] $G$ in the plane is a representation of $G$ on $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ in which vertices are associated with points of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and edges are associated with homeomorphic images of $[0,1]$
More concretely, given a graph $G=(V,E,\phi)$, with  $\left| V \right|=n$ and $\left| E \right|=m$, a drawing of $G$ is the union of the [[Injective Functions|injective]] [[Linear Maps|map]] $\mathcal{D}_{\phi}:V\to \mathbb{R}^{2}$, which gives the [[Image and Pre-Image|images]] of the vertices in the plane, and the map $\mathcal{D}_{\phi}:\left\{ 1,\dots,m \right\}\times [0,1]\to \mathbb{R}^{2}$, which is such that for each $j\in\left\{ 1,..,m \right\}$, $\mathcal{D}_{E,j}:[0,1]\to \mathbb{R}^{2}$ defined by $\mathcal{D}_{\phi ,j}(x)=\mathcal{D}_{\phi}(j,x)$ is a homeomorphism onto its image such that if $\phi(e_{j})=\left\{ u,v \right\}$, then $\left\{ \mathcal{D}_{V}(u),\mathcal{D}_{V}(v) \right\}=\left\{ \mathcal{D}_{\phi,j}(0),\mathcal{D}_{\phi,j}(i) \right\}$. GIven a drawing of a graph $G$, $\mathcal{D}_{G}=(\mathcal{D}_{V},\mathcal{D}_{\phi})$, the image of the drawing, denoted by $D_{G}$, is the union of the images of the maps $\mathcal{D}_{V}$ and $\mathcal{D}_{E}$
Given a drawing of a graph $G$, we say the edges $e_{i}$ and $e_{j}$ cross
