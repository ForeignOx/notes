Assumptions: Objects are uniform bodies, impulse acts along the line joining their centres, the contact is smooth, assume there is no rotation (this is implied by smooth)
## Example
Two spheres, A and B with masses 2kg and 3kg respectively and equal radii, are moving on a smooth horizontal plane when they collide. Immediately before the collision, A is moving at $5\pu{ ms-1 }$ at an angle of $30^{\circ}$ and B is moving at $2\pu{ ms-1 }$ at an angle of $60^{\circ}$ to the line of centres, the coefficient of restitution is 0.5

$$
0.5=\frac{v_{b}-v_{a}}{5\cos 30+2\cos 60}
$$
$$
v_{b}-v_{a}=\frac{5\sqrt{ 3 }}{4}+\frac{1}{2}=\frac{5\sqrt{ 3 }+2}{4}
$$
