Recall Newton's experimental law:
the coefficient of restitution $e=\frac{\text{speed of separation}}{\text{speed of approach}}$, $0\leq e \leq 1$ 
Consider a smooth plane:
![[Untitled 2024-02-05 12.26.23.excalidraw]]
We assume the impulse of the collision acts perpendicular to the plane, so
$$
e=\frac{v\sin\alpha}{u\sin\theta}
$$
We also assume the plane is smooth so the component of the velocity parallel to the plane is unchanged:
$$
v\cos\alpha=u\cos\theta
$$
## Example
A ball is initially moving at $30^\circ$ to a smooth plane. The coefficient of restitution between the ball and plane is $0.8$
a) Find the direction in which the ball moves after colliding with the plane
$e=0.8$, $u\cos 30=v\cos \theta$, $0.8=\frac{v\sin\theta}{u\sin 30}$, $\implies v\sin\theta=0.4u$
$$
\frac{v\sin\theta}{v\cos\theta}=\frac{0.4u}{\frac{u\sqrt{ 3 }}{2}}\implies \tan\theta=\frac{0.8}{\sqrt{ 3 }}\implies\theta=24.8^{\circ}
$$
