Consider a particle that is experiencing forces in a [[Uniform Electric Field]]. We'll consider that all other forces on the particle are negligible. This generally requires the particle to be in a vacuum, so there are no collision forces on it
The force, $qE$, on a [[Electric Charge|charged]] particle is the same in magnitude and direction wherever the particle is in a uniform [[Electric Fields|electric field]]. This implies that:
- Its [[Components of vectors|component]] of [[Velocity]] at right angles to the field doesn't change
- Its component of velocity in the direction of the field changes at a constant [[Acceleration]] given by:
$$
a=\frac{F}{m}=\frac{qE}{m}
$$
So the particle's path is either straight or parabolic, and the exact path can be calculated mathematically using the [[Uniform Acceleration Equations]]
## Change of Speed in relation to [[Potential Difference]]
Suppose a particle of mass $m$ and charge $q$ moves from $A$ to $B$ in an electric field (not necessarily uniform), we know that the [[Kinetic Energy]] gained by the particle is equal to the [[Electrical Potential Energy]] lost by the particle, so:
$$
\frac{1}{2}m(v_{B}^{2}-v_{A}^{2})=-q\Delta V
$$
In which $\Delta V$ is the potential difference in going from $A$ to $B$. Note that the value of $q$ is signed
