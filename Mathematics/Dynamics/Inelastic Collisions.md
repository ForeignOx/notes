Inelastic collisions are collisions where [[Kinetic Energy|kinetic energy]] is lost. These tend to occur when two objects collide and then combine into one object, while energy is lost, [[Momentum|momentum]] is conserved.
## Example
[[mass|Mass]] $2m$ with [[Speed|speed]] collides with stationary mass $m$. Afterwards, they move in the same direction and the $2m$-particle moves with speed $\frac{1}{2}v$. What is the speed $u$ of the other particle, and what is the fraction $Z$ of energy lost?
First draw pictures for before and after
![[Law of Conservation of Momentum 2025-01-29 11.10.59.excalidraw]]
By considering [[Law of Conservation of Momentum|conservation of momentum]],
$$
2mv+m\times 0=2m\frac{1}{2}v+mu
$$
$$
\implies u=v
$$
Now we find $Z$:
$$
Z=\frac{E_\text{lost}}{E_\text{initial}}=\frac{E_\text{initial}-E_\text{after}}{E_\text{initial}}=1-\frac{E_\text{after}}{E_\text{initial}}
$$
$$
=1- \frac{\frac{1}{2}\times 2m\times \left( \frac{1}{2}v \right)^{2}+\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}}{\frac{1}{2}\times 2m\times v^{2}}=1-\frac{3}{4}=\frac{1}{4}
$$
If we ignored the moving in the same direction, we could have the same as before, or we could have:
![[Inelastic Collisions 2025-01-29 11.21.42.excalidraw]]
Then
$$
2mv=-2m\frac{1}{2}v+mu\implies u=3v
$$
And
$$
Z=1-\frac{\frac{1}{4}mv^{2}+\frac{9}{2}mv^{2}}{\frac{1}{2}\times 2m\times v^{2}}=-\frac{15}{4}
$$
Which is impossible, the energy after was more than the energy before? This could happen if some external feature involved itself, but in this simple model, we forbid this
