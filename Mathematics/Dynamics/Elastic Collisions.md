Elastic collisions are collisions where no [[Kinetic Energy|kinetic energy]] is lost. This typically involves two objects moving towards each other, colliding, and then moving away from each other
## Example
[[Mass|Mass]] $2m$ with [[speed|speed]] $v$ collides elastically with stationary mass $m$, afterwards, they move in same direction, what's the speed of each particle afterwards?
If this was not an elastic collision, we could not predict the results (without using [[Coefficient of Restitution|coefficient of restitution]])

Considering [[Law of Conservation of Momentum|conservation of momentum]]:
$$
2mv=2mw+mu
$$
Considering [[Principle of Conservation of Energy|conservation of energy]]:
$$
mv^{2}=mw^{2}+\frac{1}{2}mu^{2}
$$
These are a set of non-linear simulatneous equations, we eliminate $w$ using the linear equation $w=v-\frac{1}{2}u$ and substitute into the non-linear equation
$$
v^{2}=\left( v-\frac{1}{2}u \right)^{2}+\frac{1}{2}u^{2}
$$
$$
\implies 0=-uv+\frac{3}{4}u^{2}
$$
$$
\implies u=0\text{ or }u=\frac{4}{3}v
$$
$u=0$ means nothing happened, particles pass without interacting, this is a special case of an elastic collision - there is no collision
Otherwise
$$
w=\frac{1}{3}v
$$
