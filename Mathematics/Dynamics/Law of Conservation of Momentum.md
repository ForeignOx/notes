The vector sum of the momenta of the bodies in an [[Git/Physics/Component 1/Dynamics/Isolated System|isolated system]] is constant
So essentially the external force $F$ is $\hspace{0pt}0$. This is trivial for a single particle. It is in fact non-trivial for collisions between two (or more) particles
It is a law of nature that the total [[Momentum|momentum]] is conserved by collisions, so
- The total momentum is the sum of the momenta of each particle
- $p$ after is equal to $p$ before for collision. I.e. momentum is conserved
The total [[Energy|energy]] (which is all kinetic energy) may be conserved, in which case the collision would be [[Elastic Collisions|elastic]], or not conserved, yielding an [[Inelastic Collisions|inelastic collision]]
