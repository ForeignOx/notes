Say you have two masses $m_{1},m_{2}$ and they form a binary star system; they might be of equal mass, and the position of each will be $\underline{r}_{1},\underline{r}_{2}$ respectively...
We can't really consider the forces they exert as central, but you can think about $\underline{r}=\underline{r}_{2}-\underline{r}_{1}$, so say there is a force $\underline{F}_{1}$ on $m_{1}$, and $\underline{F}_{2}$ on $m_{2}$, with $\underline{F}_{2}=-\underline{F}_{1}=\underline{F}$ (as they must be equal and opposite forces)
Then
$$
\ddot{\underline{r}}=\ddot{\underline{r}}_{2}- \ddot{\underline{r}}_{1}=\frac{\underline{F}_{2}}{m_{2}}-\frac{\underline{F}_{1}}{m_{1}}=\left( \frac{1}{m_{2}}+\frac{1}{m_{1}} \right)\underline{F}
$$
$$
\implies \mu   \ddot{\underline{r}}=\underline{F}
$$
Where $\mu=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{m_{1}}+\frac{1}{m_{2}}}=\frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}$
