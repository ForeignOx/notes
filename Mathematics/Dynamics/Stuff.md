Consider if 
$$
V(x)=\frac{1}{4}x^{4}-\frac{1}{3}x^{3}-x^{2}
$$
$$
 V'(x)=x(x+1)(x-2)
$$
Equilibira at $x=0,-1,2$
Say we start at $x=1$ with speed $u$. How large must $u$ be to reach $x=-1$? Need enough energy to get over 'hill' at $x=0$

The initial direction doesn't actually matter (?)
The equation we want will be something like
$$
E=\frac{1}{2}mu^{2}+V(1)=\text{(tiny bit)}+V(0)
$$
The "tiny bit" is because we don't want to just stop at the top of the hill. THus
$$
\frac{1}{2}mu^{2}+V(1)>V(0)
$$
$$
\implies \frac{3}{2}u^{2}-\frac{13}{12}>0\iff u>\sqrt{ \frac{13}{18} }
$$
