If we take the time derivative of angular momentum for a particle of [[mass|mass]] $m$ at [[position|position]] $\underline{r}$ with [[Velocity|velocity]] $\underline{\dot{r}}$, we have:
$$
\frac{d }{dt} \underline{L}=m \underbrace{ \underline{\dot{r}}\times\underline{v} }_{ =\underline{0} }+m\underline{r}\times  \underline{\dot{v}}=\underline{r} \times (m\underline{\dot{v}})=\underline{r}\times \underline{F}
$$
Where the final equality is given by Newton's second law
Note: if $\underline{F}=\alpha \underline{r}$ for some [[Real Functions|real]] [[Functions|function]] $\alpha$, the torque is zero and $\underline{L}$ is conserved; it is constant in time
We can have repulsive and attractive forces:

## With Moments
In order to change the [[Angular Momentum]] of a body, we need a couple, which is two equal and opposite forces with different lines of action:
![[Angular Momentum 2024-04-23 22.14.34.excalidraw]]
The turning effect of a couple is its [[Moments|moment]] or torque, $\tau$. The moment of the couple about any point on the diagram is given by:
$$
\tau=Fd
$$
But can't we produce a rotation without having two forces, just by having a single force applied off-centre? Consider a ball affected by an off-centre force $F$, which can be considered to be a force through the [[Centre of Mass|centre of mass]] (which produces linear [[Acceleration]]) and a couple, which produces [[Angular Acceleration]]
![[Torque 2024-04-23 22.24.28.excalidraw]]
The angular acceleration, $\alpha$, is calculated from $\tau=I\alpha$, which is the rotational equivalent of [[Newton's Second Law of Motion]], $F=ma$
