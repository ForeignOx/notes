The moment of inertia, $I$, of an object consisting of $n$ particles is defined by:
$$
I=\sum_{i=1}^nm_{i}r_{i}^{2}
$$
where $m_{i}$ and $r_{i}$ are the mass and distance from the axis of rotation of the $i$th particle. The moment of inertia is the rotational equivalent of [[Mass]]
Working out the moment of inertia of an extended solid object can be tricky, unless it has an easy symmetrical shape. An exception is a thin uniform cylindrical ring:

This is easy because all the particles are at the same distance $r$, from the axis of rotation, $C$. Hence, $I=mr^{2}$. Here are some standard formulae for moments of inertia:

| Object          | $I$                  |
| --------------- | -------------------- |
| Uniform ring    | $mr^{2}$             |
| Uniform disc    | $\frac{1}{2}mr^{2}$  |
| Solid sphere    | $\frac{2}{5}mr^{2}$  |
| Spherical shell | $\frac{2}{3}mr^{2}$  |
| Uniform rod     | $\frac{1}{12}mr^{2}$ |
## Example
Consider the moment of inertia $I$ of a square light plate with $\hspace{0pt}4$ masses $m$ attached to each cornier, with side-length $D$, about an axis perpendicular to plate halfway along an edge:
![[Moment of Inertia 2025-03-17 14.24.41.excalidraw]]
We do this by considering each mass and using [[Pythagoras' Theorem|pythagoras]]
$$
I=m\left( \frac{D}{2} \right)^{2}+{m}\left( \frac{D}{2} \right)^{2}+m\left( \left( \frac{D}{2} \right)^{2}+D^{2} \right)+m\left( \left( \frac{D}{2} \right)^{2}+D^{2} \right)=3mD^{2}
