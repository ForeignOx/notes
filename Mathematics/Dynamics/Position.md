The position of a particle is usually given by $x(t)$, where $t$ is time
![[Position 2025-01-13 14.07.12.excalidraw]]
In $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ we instead denote this as a [[Vectors|vector]] $\underline{r}(t)$ relative to some origin O
We denote the distance to the origin as $r=\left| \underline{r} \right|$. The components of $\underline{r}$ in the [[Standard Basis Vectors|cartesian basis]] $\underline{e}_{1},\underline{e}_{2},\underline{e}_{3}$ are $x,y,z$, so $\underline{r}=x\underline{e}_{1}+y\underline{e}_{2}+z\underline{e}_{3}$; $\underline{r}$ is a [[Linear Combinations|linear combination]] of the basis vectors
## Relative Motion
If we have two particles $A$ and $B$
![[Inclined Plane 2025-01-31 16.46.16.excalidraw]]
Then the position of $B$ relative to $A$ is $\underline{r}_{BA}=\underline{r}_{B}-\underline{r}_{A}$
So the we can essentially consider one constant, the other as our only particle moving
