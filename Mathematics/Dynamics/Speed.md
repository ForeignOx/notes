Speed is the rate of change of distance with respect to time, $c=\frac{dd}{dt}$, where $c$ is speed and $d$ is distance. Speed is a [[Scalar Quantities|scalar]], the vector equivalent is [[velocity|velocity]]
Speed is the magnitude of velocity, $\left| v(t) \right|=\left| \underline{\dot{r}} \right|$
