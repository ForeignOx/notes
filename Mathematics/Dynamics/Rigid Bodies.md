A rigid body is a system of particles such that the position of any particle relative to any other particle is fixed. Motion of a rigid body is complicated in general. The simplest is motion without rotation; it behaves like a single particle at the [[Centre of Mass|centre of mass]] $\underline{R}(t)$
The next-simplest is to allow rotation about a fixed axis. The position of the body is given by $\theta(t)$, such that all the particles have the same [[Angular Velocity|angular velocity]] $\dot{\theta}$, an example of this is in generalisations of [[Simple Pendula|simple pendulum]] to [[Compound Pendula|compound pendula]]
