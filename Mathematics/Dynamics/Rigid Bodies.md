A rigid body is a system of particles such that the position of any particle relative to any other particle is fixed. Motion of a rigid body is complicated in general. The simplest is motion without rotation; it behaves like a single particle at the [[Centre of Mass|centre of mass]] $\underline{R}(t)$
The next-simplest is to allow rotation about a fixed axis. The position of the body is given by $\theta(t)$, such that all the particles have the same [[Angular Velocity|angular velocity]] $\dot{\theta}$, an example of this is in generalisations of [[Simple Pendula|simple pendulum]] to compound pendula
## Example
Say we have a [[light|light]] rod and two masses:
![[Rigid Bodies 2025-03-10 14.33.56.excalidraw]]
Then the distance $D$ from the axis to the centre of mass is 
$$
D=\frac{1}{2m}\left( m\cdot \frac{L}{2}+m\cdot L \right)=\frac{3}{4}L
$$
And the [[Moment of Inertia|moment of inertia]] is:
$$
I=m\left( \frac{L}{2} \right)^{2}+mL^{2}=\frac{5}{4}mL^{2}
$$

Say you have a light rod or length $L$, with the three masses as shown:
