For any object one can identify a point at which it's weight is considered to act is as the centre of mass, aka centre of gravity. In symmetric body of uniform [[Density]], the centre of mass will lie on every line of symmetry. If an object's centre of mass is outside of the object, it can topple. For a standing object, the lower the centre of mass is, the lower the centre of mass, the more stable they are and the less likely they are to topple over. 
Recall for point masses, $m_{1}, m_{2}, \dots, m_{n}$ along a light rod at distances $x_{1}, x_{2}, \dots, x_{n}$ we calculate the centre of mass using moments:
![[Centres of Mass 2024-02-16 12.40.52.excalidraw]]
Which can be calculated as
$$
m_{1}gx_{1}+m_{2}gx_{2}+\dots+m_{n}gx_{n}=(m_{1}+m_{2}+\dots+m_{n})\bar{x}
$$
$$
\implies \sum(m_{i}x _{i})=\bar{x}\sum m_{i}
$$
$$
\implies \bar{x}=\frac{\sum(m_{i}x_{i})}{\sum m_{i}}
$$
This idea extends to more dimensions, say you have a system of $N$ particles, with masses $m_{1},m_{2},\dots ,m_{N}$ at positions $\underline{r}_{1},\underline{r}_{2},\dots,\underline{r}_{N}$ has a centre of mass at
$$
\underline{R}=\frac{m_{1}\underline{r}_{1}+m_{2}\underline{r}_{2}+\dots+m_{N}\underline{r}_{N}}{m_{1}+m_{2}+\dots+m_{N}}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}m_{i}\underline{r}_{i}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}m_{i}}
$$
