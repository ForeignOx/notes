Velocity is the rate of change of displacement with respect to time, $v=\frac{ds}{dt}$, velocity is a [[Vectors|vector]], the scalar equivalent is [[Speed]]. We can also say $\bar{v}=\frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}$
It is also considered as rate of change of [[Position|position]]
$$
v(t)=\dot{x}
$$
Or in higher dimensions, such as $\mathbb{R}^{3}$,
$$
\underline{v}=\underline{\dot{r}}=\dot{x}\underline{e}_{1}+\dot{y}\underline{e}_{2}+\dot{z}\underline{e}_{3}
$$
Note that the [[Standard Basis Vectors|basis vectors]] are constant
