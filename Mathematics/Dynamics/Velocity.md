Velocity is the rate of change of displacement with respect to time, $v=\frac{ds}{dt}$, velocity is a [[Vector Quantities|vector]], the scalar equivalent is [[Speed]]. We can also say $\bar{v}=\frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}$
It is also considered as rate of change of [[Position|position]]
$$
v(t)=\dot{x}
