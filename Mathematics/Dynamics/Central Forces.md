A force $\underline{F}$ is a central foce if it has the form
$$
\underline{F}=f(r)\underline{e}_{r}=r^{-1}f(r)\underline{r}
$$
Note that $\left| \underline{F} \right|=\left| f \right|$
Where $\underline{r}$ is the [[Position|position]]
So the [[Angular Momentum|angular momentum]] $\underline{L}=m\underline{r}\times  \underline{\dot{r}}$ is conserved, also $\underline{L}\cdot \underline{r}=0$ ($\underline{r}\times  \underline{\dot{r}}$ is orthogonal to $\underline{r}$)
This $\underline{L}\cdot \underline{r}=0$ defines a [[Planes in R3|plane in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$]] through the origin. Importantly this is a constant plane, so the trajectory of the particle lies in this fixed plane, which we can take to be the $xy$-plane
This means $\underline{L}=L\underline{e}_{3}$ pointing in $z$-direction
## Examples
[[Newton's Law of Gravitation|Gravity]] is a central force in the case of planet moving around a fixed star. Gravity is always attractive with $f(r)=-\frac{k}{r^{2}}$ with $k>0$ constant
