For a body to be in equilibrium if the resultant force on the object is 0, and the resultant [[Moments|moment]] is 0 ([[Principle of Moments|principle of moments]]). A body can be in equilibrium and be moving and rotating if it is doing so at a constant rate. 
If a body in equilibrium has 3 non-parallel forces acting on it, all the lines of action of the forces must pass through a single point.
## Energy
Since $F=0$ at a point of equilibrium, the [[Energy|potential energy]] has the property that $V'(x)=0$, since $V(x)=-\int F \, dx$
