Assume we have two [[Power Series|power series]], assume they are equal in some (small) neighbourhood of $x=0$; $\left| x \right|<\epsilon$
$$
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_{k}x^{k}=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} b_{k}x^{k}  =f(x)
$$
Then $(a_{k})=(b_{k})$
## Proof
We consider the $n$th [[Differentiation|derivative]] of $f$ at 0;
$$
f^{(n)}(0)=n!a_{n}=n!b_{n}
$$
$$
\implies a_{n}=b_{n}\forall n
$$
