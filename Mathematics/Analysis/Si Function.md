$$
Si(x)=\int_{0}^{x} \frac{\sin(t)}{t} \, dt 
$$
By [[L'Hopital's Rule|L'Hopital's rule]], $Si(x)$ is [[Continuity|continuous]] at $t=0$, the issue is what happens as $x\to \infty$, we get [[Improper Integrals|improper]] :(
Here is the graph of $\frac{\sin(x)}{x}$
```desmos-graph
\sin(x)/x
```
It ends up that the limit as $x\to \infty$, is [[Conditional Convergence|conditionally convergent]]
