Many [[Functions|functions]] cannot be obtained in an 'elementary' way, but rather arise by a [[Limit|limit]] process, for example $e^{ x }=\lim_{ n \to \infty }\left( 1+\frac{x}{n} \right)^{n}$. Particularly attractive are infinite [[Series|series]] of functions $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} g_{k}(x)$, viewed as the limit of partial sums $f_{n}(x)=\sum_{ k=0} ^{ n} g_{k}(x)$. For example [[Power Series|power series]] are of this type
Given a function $f$, one can also seek to represent by an infinite series of (simpler) functions for example its [[Taylor Series|Taylor Series]] or for [[Periodic Functions|periodic functions]] its [[Fourier Series|fourier series]]
We can use step functions to approximate [[Continuity|continuous]] functions on a more compact [[Intervals|interval]] uniformly to arbitrary precision and use this then to extend the notion of [[Integration|integration]] for step functions to the one for continuous functions
One fundamental question in this process is under which circumstances the limit function $f$ inherits the properties of the functions $f_{n}$, say continuity or differentiability
If we have
$$
f_{n}(x):I\to \mathbb{R}
$$
Is a sequence of functions
