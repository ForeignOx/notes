We define the [[Integration|integral]] of a [[Step Functions|step function]] as the signed area of the rectangles
![[Riemann Sum 2025-03-10 16.15.10.excalidraw]]
$$
I(f)=\sum_{k=0}^{N}(x_{k+1}-x_{k})f(x_{k}^{*})
$$
Where $x_{k}^{*}\in(x_{k},x_{k+1})$. We call this a Riemann sum.
It is independent of the choice of underlying partition and doesn't depend on the value at $x_{0},\dots,x_{N}$
