If you have $m$ distinct objects, choose $r$ of them with replacement, then the number of different ordered lists ($r$-tuples) is equal to $\underbrace{ m\times m\times \dots \times m }_{ r\text{ times} }=m^{r}$
## Arrangements
This can also be thought of as the problem of how many [[Arrangements|arrangements]] of length $r$ can be made from elements of a [[Sets|set]] $S$ of size $|S|=m$. The answer is $m^{r}$ as each arrangement has $r$ places which can be occupied by the $m$ entries and order matters
This is because the arrangement corresponds to the $r$-tuple in the [[Set Operations#Cartesian Product|cartesian product]] $S^{r}$, and we are finding $\left| S^{r} \right|=\left| S \right|^{r}=m^{r}$
