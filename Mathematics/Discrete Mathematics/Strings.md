In the studies of algebraic coding theory and the theory of computer languages, we consider certain [[Arrangements old|arrangements]], called strings, made up from a prescribed alphabet of symbols
If the prescribbed alphabet consists of the symbols $\hspace{0pt}0$, $\hspace{0pt}1$, and $\hspace{0pt}2$, for example, then $01,11,21,12$ are $\hspace{0pt}4$ of the $\hspace{0pt}9$ strings of length $\hspace{0pt}2$. Among the $\hspace{0pt}27$ strings of length $\hspace{0pt}3$ are $000,012,210,222$
In general, if $n$ is any positive integer, then by the [[Rule of Product|rule of product]], there are $k^{n}$ strings of length $n$ with an alphabet of $k$ characters
