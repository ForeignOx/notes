An arrangement or list or string is a (finite) sequence of items in which order is important
The length of the arrangement is the number of items in the sequence
## Non-Linear Arrangements
Sometimes arrangements are non-linear and form some greater structure, which makes counting problems with them more difficult. A good way to deal with these however is to attempt to find an ordering that can be used as a linear arrangement and finding if that creates duplicate solutions, then removing them.
### Circular Arrangements
An example of a non-linear arrangement is a circular arrangement, if you imagnine $n$ objects in a circle, you could choose one at random to start and then go round the circle to have a linear arrangement, and there are $n$ ways you could do this, so you can divide the solution to your combinatorial problem by $n$ and treat it as linear
