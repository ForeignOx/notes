You can think about it as if you have $m$ places, $r$ of these will be filled with objects of type $\hspace{0pt}1$, then the remaining $m-r$ places must then be filled with the objects of type 2
## Example
Toss a "fair" coin $\hspace{0pt}7$ times
$$
E:=\{ \text{There are a total of }3\text{ heads, H} \}
$$
Find $\mathbb{P}(E)$
The unrestricted number of all possible choices is $|\Omega|=2^7$
