What is the point of [[Bayesian Statistics|Bayesian Stats]] nonsense?
We have seen how to find the Bayesian posterior $f(\theta|x)$, but
- What can we do with this? 
- What does it give us?
Apparently, it gives us everything. (this is a **very** dubious statement but ok Ian pop off)
We can now answer any question about $\theta$ and by extension about future measurements probabilistically
This is often used in Decision Theory to make optimal decisions under uncertainty. It is hard to overstate the importance of this capability! (average stats propaganda)
