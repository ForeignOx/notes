The $\chi ^{2}$ with $\nu$ degrees of freedom is the distribution formed by summing $\nu$ squares of $N(0,1)$ variables:
For $\nu$ independent $Z_{i} \sim N(0,1)$, we can say that $X=Z_{1}^{2}+Z_{2}^{2}+\dots+Z_{\nu}^{2}$ has a $\chi_{\nu}^{2}$ distribution which has PDF of
$$
f(x)=\frac{e^{-x/2}x^{(\nu-2)/2}}{2^{\nu/2}\Gamma\left( \frac{\nu}{2} \right)}
$$
