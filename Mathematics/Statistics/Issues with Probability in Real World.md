As we have [[Probabilities|$0\leq \mathbb{P}(A)\leq 1$]], we say that $\mathbb{P}(A)=1$ means that $A$ is certain, and similarly $\mathbb{P}(A)=0$ means that $A$ is impossible
So probability is an extension of the concept of logic, so $A$ is true = $\hspace{0pt}1$, but $A$ is false is $\hspace{0pt}0$.
If $0<\mathbb{P}(A)<1$, then the probability indicates our degree of belief of the likelyhood of the event $A$ actually occuring, but this gives the questions; what is $\mathbb{P}(A)$? How do we choose its value?
For repeatable experiments, such as rolling dice, this question is more easy, but many real-life scenarios such as global warming, this is not so clear
The axioms are useful, but say nothing about how we should decide our initial probabilities
Logic provides us with consistency and ways to go when you have started, so if $A\implies B$, then if $A$ is true $B$ is true, but logic tells us nothing about whether $A$ is true. The same goes for probability.
