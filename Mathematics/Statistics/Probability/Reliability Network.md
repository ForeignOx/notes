Reliability theory concerns mathematical models of systems that may be functional depending on whether certain components function. If a component fails randomly, reliability theory 
Also known as current flow, a reliability network is a way of

System is functional if both components $\hspace{0pt}1$ and $\hspace{0pt}2$ are working:
