## Example
A gene X can either have allele $A$ or $a$
Female: XX - two alleles
Male: XY - one allele
Let $aa\to$ unhealthy for female
$a\to$ unhealthy for male
Everything else is healthy
A male child gets the X chromosome from the mother, and the Y chromosome from the father, so the allele on the male child's X chromosome is from the mother so equal chance to inherit either of the alleles
A female child gets one X chromosome from the mother, and the X chromosome fom the father
Jane is healthy, maternal aunt of Jane has an unhealthy son (he has $a$ allele), Jane's maternal grandparent and father are healthy 
Let $J:=\{ \text{Jane is }Aa \}$, Let $M_{1}=\{ \}$
