Probability is based on axioms. 
Probability is a measure of chance that we assign to [[events|events]] $A\in\mathfrak{F}$
Associated to [[Sample Spaces|$\Omega$]], there is a collection denoted as $\mathfrak{F}$, which is the collection of all possible events:
$$
\mathfrak{F}=\{ A|A\subseteq\Omega \}
$$
For finite $\Omega$, we will take [[Power Sets|$\mathfrak{F}=2^\Omega$]]
