Bivariate data is data involving two variables, where each value of one variable is paired with a value of the other variable. Bivariate data can occur in two forms:
## Random on Non-Random
In this case, only one of the variables can be considered as a random variable. This usually occurs when one of the variables (the independent variable) is controlled by an experimenter, and the other (the dependent variable) is measured
## Random on Random
In this case, both variables can be considered as random variables
