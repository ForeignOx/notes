A sample is a [[Subsets|subset]] of the [[Population|population]] that is examined
A statistic is a number that is calculated from the sample data, ususally a summary:
- the smaple mean $\overline{X}$, sample variance $s^{2}$
- sample proportion $y=\hat{p}$
The sampling distrubution is the distribution of the statistic that describes how it can vary from sample to samply
Statistics are often used as estimators of population parmeters, for example using $\hat{p}$ as an estimator for $p$
We will be concerned with certain aspects of estimators:
- whether or not they are biased; if $E(\text{estimator})=\text{pop. parameter}$ or not, where the expectation comes from the distribution of all possible samples
- degree of variability (same as above, but for variance), variability is usually proportional to $\frac{1}{\text{sample size}}$
