The correspondence between the [[Real Numbers|real numbers]] and points on a number line can be used to construct a coordinate system for the plane by drawing two numer lines that are mutually pependicular and intersect at their origins, these are called coordinate axes, the horizontal axis is usually labeled the $x$-axis and vertical axis is usually labelled the $y$-axis. Let $O$ be the point of intersection, it is called the origin. It is customary to have one of the lines be horizontal, with the positive numbers above $O$. The coordinate axes separate the plane into $\hspace{0pt}4$ regions called quadrants which are commonly labelled as so:

Regular coordinates are assigned to points of the plane as follows: the point on the $x$-axis with line coordinate $a$ is assigned rectangular coordinates $(a,0)$. The point on the $y$-axis with line coordinate $b$ is assigned rectangular coordinates $(0,b)$. Thus the origin is assigned coordinates $(0,0)$. A point $P$ not on one of the coordinate axes is assigned coordinates $(a,b)$ provided that the line $l_{1}$ passes through $P$ and is parallel to the $y$-axis and intersects the $x$-axis at the point $(a,0)$, and the line $l_{2}$ that passes through $P$ and is parallel to the $x$-axis intersects the $y$-axis at the point with coordinates $(0,b)$

This procedure assigns an ordered pair of real numbers to each point of the plane. Moreover, the procedure is reversible. Given any ordered pair $(c,d)$ of real numbers, there is a unique point $Q$ in the plane with coordinates $(c,d)$
To indicate that $P$ has coordinates $(a,b)$ we write $P(a,b)$. The number $a$ is called the $x$-coordinate (the abscissa), and the number $b$ is called the $y$-coordinate (the ordinate)
This coordinate system is known as the cartesian coordinate system
