Consider
$$
S=\left\{ \overline{0},\overline{1},\overline{2} \right\}
$$
Is this a group under multiplication? We would need to take $\overline{1}$ as the identity, but then $\overline{0}$ doesn't have an inverse, since $\overline{0}=0\mod3$, so we can just remove it;
$$
\mathbb{Z}_{3}^{\times}=\left\{ \overline{1},\overline{2} \right\}
$$
Is a multiplicative group, it is in fact [[Isomorphisms|isomorphic]] to [[Cyclic Groups|$\mathbb{Z}_{n}$]]
