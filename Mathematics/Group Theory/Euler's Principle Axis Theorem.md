Every rotation in $\hspace{0pt}3$-Dimensions has an axis
I.e. if $M\in SO(3)$, there is a non-zero vector $\underline{v}$ such that $M\underline{v}=\underline{v}$ ($\underline{v}$ is the axis of rotation)
## Proof
All we need to do is show that $M\in SO(3)\implies 1$ is an [[Eigenvalues|eigenvalue]] of $M$. 
The eigenvalues of $M$ are the roots of 
$$
p_{M}(t)=
$$
