A group is a set, $G$, and a binary operation, $*$ such that the group, $(G,*)$, fulfils the following axioms:
- Identity - $\exists e\in G:  g*e=e*g=g, \forall g \in G$
- (Left) Inverse - $\forall g \in G, \exists g ^{-1}\in G:g^{-1}*g=e$
- Closure - $\forall a,b\in G, a*b \in G$
- Associativity - $\forall a,b,c \in G, (a*b)*c=a*(b*c)$
A finite group $~G$ is a group having finitely many elements, the order $\left| G \right|$ is the number of elements
