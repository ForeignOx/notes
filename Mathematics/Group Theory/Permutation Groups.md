If a [[Groups|group]] is formed by a [[Permutations|permutation set]] then it forms a permutation group
All elements can be decomposed into two-cycles/transpositions
The elements which have an even number of two-cycles form a [[Subgroups|subgroup]], called the Alternating Group $A_{n}$ which has order $\frac{1}{2}n$
