The [[Order of Elements|order]] of any [[Subgroups|subgroup]] of a finite [[Groups|group]] is a factor of the order of the group, i.e. $H\subseteq G$, then $\left| H \right|$ divides $\left| G \right|$
## Proof
Let element $a$ have order $k$
Then $<a> = \{ e,a,a^{2},\dots,a^{k-1} \}$
The size of the cyclic subgroup generated by $a$ is the same as the order of $a$, so it must be a factor of the order of the group
