A finite continued fraction is an expression of the form
$$
a_{0}+\frac{1}{a_{1}+\frac{1}{a_{2}+\frac{1}{\ddots \frac{\vdots}{a_{n-1}+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}}}}
$$
where $a_{0}\in\mathbb{Z}$, $a_{1},a_{2},\dots,a_{n}\in\mathbb{Z}$
We can write a continued fraction as: 
$$
a_{0}+\frac{1}{a_{1}+\frac{1}{a_{2}+\frac{1}{\ddots \frac{\vdots}{a_{n-1}+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}}}}=[a_{0};a_{1},a_{2},\dots,a_{n}]
$$
The representation $[a_{0};a_{1},a_{2},\dots,a_{n}]$ for $a_{n}\geq 2$ is unique, however there is also the equivalent representation:
$$
[a_{0};a_{1},a_{2},\dots,a_{n-1}a_{n}-1, 1]
$$
However we usually use the first representation, aka the canonical representation
