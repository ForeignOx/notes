A continued fraction is an expression obtained through an iterative process of representing a number as the sum of its integer part and the reciprocal of another number, then writing this other number as the sum of its integer part and another reciprocal, and so on. In a [[finite continued fraction]] (or terminated continued fraction), the iteration/recursion is terminated after finitely many steps by using an integer in lieu of another continued fraction. In contrast, an [[infinite continued fraction]] is an infinite expression. In either case, all integers in the sequence, other than the first, must be positive. The integers $a_{i}$ are called the coefficients or terms of the continued fraction.
It is generally assumed that the numerator of all the fractions is 1. If arbitrary values or functions are used in place of one or more of the numerators or the integers in the denominators, the resulting expression is a generalized continued fraction. When it is necessary to distinguish the first form from generalized continued fractions, the former may be called a simple or regular continued fraction, or said to be in canonical form.
