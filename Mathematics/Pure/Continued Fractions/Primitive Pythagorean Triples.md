All positive integer solutions of the equation $x^{2}+y^{2}=z^{2}$ such that [[Greatest Common Divisor|$gcd(x,y,z)=1$]] (called primitive pythagorean triples) with $2|x$ are given by $x=2st$, $y=t^{2}-s^{2}$, $z=s^{2}+t^{2}$ such that $t>s>0$, $gcd(s,t)=1$ and $s$ has a different parity to $t$ (one is even, one is odd)
