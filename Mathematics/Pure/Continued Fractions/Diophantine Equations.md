A diophantine equation is a polynomial equation with integer coefficients such that only integer solutions are sought
When we are given a diophantine equation, we typically look to investigate:
1. are there any solutions?
2. if so, are there finitely many or infinitely many?
3. can we find all the solutions?

## Continued Fractions
The [[convergents]] of a [[finite continued fraction]] can be used to generate all solutions to the diophantine equation $ax+by=1$ for $a,b\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $gcd(a,b)=1$
