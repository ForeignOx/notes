For a solid of revolution,
$$
V=2\pi \bar{y}A
$$
Where $V$ is the volume of revolution (generated by rotating and enclosed area $A$ about an external axis), $A$ is the area of the object that was rotated, and $2\pi \bar{y}$ s the distance travelled in the rotation by the centre of mass of the 2D area
## Proof
(Diagram from ~45 mins)
Volume element $=\pi y_{2}^{2}\delta x-\pi y_{1}^{2}\delta x$
Let $\delta x\to 0$:
Total volume:
$$
V=\pi \int ^{b}_{a} y_{2}^{2}-y_{1}^{2} \, dx 
$$
$$
\implies \int ^{b}_{a} y_{2}^{2}-y_{1}^{2} \, dx =\frac{V}{\pi}
$$
Area element, CoM is at $\frac{1}{2}(y_{1}+y_{2})$
Element moment $=\frac{1}{2}(y_{1}+y_{2})(y_{2}-y_{1})\delta x$
$$
A\bar{y}=\int ^{b}_{a} \frac{1}{2}(y_{1}+y_{2})(y_{2}-y_{1}) \, dx =\frac{1}{2}\int ^{b}_{a} y_{2}^{2}-y_{1}^{2} \, dx 
$$
Substituting the equations:
$$
A\bar{y}=\frac{\frac{1}{2}V}{\pi}
$$
$$
\implies V=2\pi \bar{y}A
$$
