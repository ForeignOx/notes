Two [[Groups]] are isomorphic ($G_{1} \cong G_{2}$) if there is a one-to-one mapping (isomorphism) that preserves the structure of the group
Two isomorphic groups are either both finite and of the same order or both infinite
Two isomorphic groups are either both [[Abelian Groups|abelian]] or both non-abelian
The identity elements of isomorphic groups are mapped to each other by the isomorphism
The inverses of corresponding elements are mapped to each other by the isomorphism
The inverses of the corresponding elements are mapped to each other by the isomorphism
The order of an element is preserved by isomorphism
