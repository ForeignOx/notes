Indices can be used to show repeated combinations of the same element, e.g. $a*a*a*a=a^{4}$
In a finite [[groups|group]], for any element $a$ there will be a positive integer $k$ such that $a^{k}=e$, this is because $a,a^{2},a^{3},\dots,a^{k}$ must be a finite set as it's a finite group, but one can multiply infinite times, and a cycle cannot loop without $e$ being in that set, so at some point, $a^{k}=e$. The smallest $k$ for which this happens is called the order of the element
For an element $a$ of a finite group $(G,*)$ such that $a$ has order $k$, the cyclic [[Subgroups|subgroup]] generated by $a$ is $<a>:=\{ e,a,a^{2},\dots,a^{k-1} \}$, if $<a> = G$ then we call the group itself cyclic and state that it is generated by $a$
In an infinite group, there can be elements which do not cycle at all, these are said to have infinite order
Note that we sometimes call the size of a group the order of the group
