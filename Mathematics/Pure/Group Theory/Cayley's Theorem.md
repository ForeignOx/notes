Every [[Groups|group]] $G$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group acting on $G$, $Sym(G)$ whose elements are the [[permutations]] of the underlying set of $G$
For each $g\in G$, the left-multiplication-by-$g$ map $l_{g}:G\to G$ sending each element $x$ to $gx$ is a permutation of $G$, and the map $G\to Sym(G)$ sending each element $g$ to $l_{g}$ is an injective homomorphism, so it defines an isomorphism from $G$ to a subgroup of $Sym(G)$
