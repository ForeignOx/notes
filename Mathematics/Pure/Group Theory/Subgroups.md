A subgroup of a [[groups|group]] $(G,*)$ is a non-empty subset of $G$ which itself forms a group, under the same binary operation $*$
The trivial subgroup is $\{e\}$
Proper subgroups are any subgroups that are strictly smaller than the original group
For finite groups, checking closure of a subset is enough to tell it is a subgroup
