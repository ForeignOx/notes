Let $(G,*)$ be a [[Groups|group]] of [[Order of Elements|order]] $p$ for some prime $p$
Let $a$ be any non-identity element of $(G,*)$
By [[Lagrange's Theorem]], $a$ has to have an order of 1 or $p$, but $a$ isn't the identity, so must have order $p$, therefore $a$ is a generator for $G$ and $G$ is cyclic
