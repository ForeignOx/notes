Let $l$ be a stright line in [[Vectorspace Rn|$\mathbb{R}^{2}$]], and let $P_{0}(x_{0},y_{0})$ and $P_{1}(x_{1},y_{1})$ be any two distinct points on $l$
## Slope
The slope of this line is defined to be:
$$
m=\frac{y_{1}-y_{0}}{x_{1}-x_{0}}=\tan\theta, \text{provided }x_{1}\neq x_{0} 
$$
Where $\theta$ is the inclination of $l$; the angle between the positively directed $x$-caxis and $l$ measured in the couterclockwise direction. If $x_{1}=x_{0}$, then $l$ is a vertical line and the slope is undefined, and $\theta=\frac{\pi}{2}$
## Intercepts
If $l$ is a nonvertical line, then it intersects the $y$-axis at a point $(0,b)$, and $b$ is known as the $y$-intercept of $l$
Similarly, if $l$ is not horizontal , then it will intersect the $x$-axis at a point $(a,0)$. The number $a$ is called the $x$-intercept of $l$
## Equations
An equation for $l$ is an equation which involves two variables, say $x$ say $y$, and has the property that a point $P(x_{0},y_{0})$ lies on $l$ iff $x_{0}$ and $y_{0}$ satisfy the equation. Here are some standard forms
- Vertical line:
$$
x=a
$$
- Horizontal line:
$$
y=b
$$
- Point-slope form:
$$
y-y_{0}=m(x-x_{0})
$$
- two-point form:
$$
y-y_{0}=\frac{y_{1}-y_{0}}{x_{1}-x_{0}}(x-x_{0})
$$
- slope-intercept form:
$$
y=mx+b
$$
- two-intercept form:
$$
\frac{x}{a}+\frac{y}{b}=1
$$
- General form:
$$
Ax+By+C=0
$$
## Parallel Lines
Given two nonvertical lines $l_{1}$ and $l_{2}$ with slopes $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ respectively, then, are parallel iff $m_{1}=m_{2}$
## Perpendicular Lines
Given two nonvertical lines $l_{1}$ and $l_{2}$ with slopes $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ respectively, then, are parallel iff $m_{1}=m_{2}$
