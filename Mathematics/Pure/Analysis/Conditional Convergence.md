Let $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_{k}$ be a [[Series|series]]. We say this series is conditionally convergent, if it is convergent, but not [[Absolute Convergence|absolutely convergent]]
## Examples
$$
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k} 
$$
Is conditionally convergent, but
$$
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k^{2}} 
$$
Is not
