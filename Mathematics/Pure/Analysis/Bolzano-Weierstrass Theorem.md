Let $(x_{n})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ be a [[Boundedness|bounded]] [[Sequences|sequence]], then $(x_{n})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ has a [[Convergence|convergent]] [[Subsequences|subsequence]]
## Proof
Let $(x_{n_{j}})_{j\in\mathbb{N}}$ be a subsequence which is monotonically increasing or decreasing, this subsequence is also bounded, since the original sequence is bounded, so by [[Every Increasing Sequence which is Bounded Above, Converges|this theorem]], $(x_{n_{j}})_{j\in\mathbb{N}}$ is convergent
