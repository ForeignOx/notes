## Example
If we change the value of $f(a)$ in an [[Exponential Functions|exponential]] [[Functions|function]]
![[Continuity 2024-10-15 14.48.21.excalidraw]]
Then [[limits|$\lim_{ x \to a }f(x)$]] still exists, and is still $L$, but we would no longer consider $f(x)$ as a continuous function; it has a discontinuity
## Definition
A function is continuous at the point $a$ if:
- $f(a)$ exists
- $\lim_{ x \to a }f(x)$ exists
- $f(a)=\lim_{ x \to a }f(x)$
