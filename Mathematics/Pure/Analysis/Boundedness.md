Let $a_{n}$ be a [[Sequences|sequence]] of real numbers
___
$a_{n}$ is bounded above if:
$$
\exists U:\forall n\in\mathbb{N},a_{n}\leq U
$$
So $U$ is an upper bound for $a_{n}$
___
$a_{n}$ is bounded below if:
$$
\exists L:\forall n\in\mathbb{N},a_{n}\geq L
$$
So $L$ is a lower bound for $a_{n}$
___
$a_{n}$ is bounded if it is both bounded above and bounded below; iff:
$$
\exists M:\forall n\in\mathbb{N},\left| a_{n} \right|\leq M
$$
___
Let $a_{n}$ be a sequence of real numbers which is bounded from above. $M\in\mathbb{R}$ is called the supremum (or least upper bound) if:
1. $M$ is an upper bound of $a_{n}$, and
2. For any $x<M$, $x$ is not an upper bound of $a_{n}$
Note that, if $x$ is not an upper bound of $a_{n}$ then there exists $i:a_{i}>x$
Note that, if $a_{n}$ is bounded from above, then it must have a supremum
