The symbols $<,>,\leq,\geq$ are called inequalities
If $a$ and $b$ are [[Real Numbers|real numbers]], then $a$ is less than $b$, denoted $a<b$ if $b-a$ is a positive number. This is equivalent to saying that $b$ is greater than $a$, which is denoted $b>a$
Geometrically, $a<b$ if the point $a$ lies to the left of the point $b$ on a number line. The notation $a\leq b$ means that either $a<b$ or $a=b$ (equivalently $b\geq a$)
The real numers are ordered in the sense that if $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, then exactly one of the following holds: $a<b,a=b,a>b$
Inequalites satisfy the following properties:
- If $a<b$ and $b<c$, then $a<c$ (transitivity)
- If $a<b$, then $a+c<b+c$ for all real numbers $c$
- If $a<b$ and $c<d$, then $a+c<b+d$
- If $a<b$ and $c>0$, then $ac<bc$
- If $a<b$ and $c<0$, then $ac>bc$
A crucial point is the last property: if an inequality is multiplied by a negative quantity, then the "direction" of the inequality is reversed
