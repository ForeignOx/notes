The natural numbers is the [[Sets|set]] of counting numbers:
$$
\mathbb{N}=\{ 1,2,3,4,\dots \}=\{ x\in \mathbb{Z}:x>0 \}
$$
$\mathbb{N}$ is the smallest [[Subsets|subset]] of [[Real Numbers|$\mathbb{R}$]] which contains $\hspace{0pt}1$, and $n\in\mathbb{N}\implies n+1\in\mathbb{N}$
Sometimes $\mathbb{N}_{0}=\mathbb{N}\cup \{ 0 \}$
The natural numbers are [[Boundedness|bounded below]]: $\hspace{0pt}1$ is a lower bound as $1\leq n\forall n\in\mathbb{N}$
Intuition tells us that $\mathbb{N}$ is not bounded above, but this requires proof
For $\mathbb{N}$ to be bounded above, we would need a real number $C\in\mathbb{R}:n\leq C\forall n\in\mathbb{N}$
We can show that it does not have a [[Maximum|maximum]] however, as it would have to be some $n\in\mathbb{N}$, but $n<n+1$, so $n\geq x\forall x\in\mathbb{N}$ is not possible, since $n+1\in\mathbb{N}$
