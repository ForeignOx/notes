A subdivision of an [[Intervals|interval]] $[a,b]$ is a partition of the interval into a finite number of subintervals:
$$
[x_{0},x_{1}],[x_{1},x_{2}],\dots,[x_{n-1},x_{n}]
$$
With
$$
a=x_{0}<x_{1}<x_{2}<\dots<x_{n}=b
$$
The norm of the subdivision $|S|$ is the maximum of the subinterval lengths
The numbers $z_{1},z_{2},\dots,z_{n}$ form a set of sample points from $X$ is $z_{j}\in[x_{j-1},x_{j}]$ for $j=1,\dots,n$
