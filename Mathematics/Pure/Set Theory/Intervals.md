Some very useful [[sets|sets]] are intervals in the [[Real Numbers|real]] line: for all the real numbers between $a$ and $b$, we write:
$$
[a,b]=\{ x \in\mathbb{R}:a\leq x\leq b \}
$$
We use square brackets when we want to include the endpoints: $a \in [a,b]$ and $b \in [a,b]$. When we don't want to include the endpoints, we use round brackets and write:
$$
(a,b)=\{ x \in \mathbb{R}:a<x<b \}
$$
We say that $[a,b]$ is a closed interval, and $(a,b)$ is an open interval. One can also mix the brackets, so for instance $[a,b)=\{ x \in \mathbb{R}:a\leq x<b \}$
