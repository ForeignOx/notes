A set is defined by the elements that belong to the set. If an element $x$ belongs to a set $S$, we write $x \in S$
Many sets will be finite or countably infinite, which means that we can write them as a (finite or infinite) list, such as
$$
S=\{ e_{1},e_{2},\dots,e_{n} \}
$$
or
$$
S=\{ e_{1},e_{2},e_{3},\dots \}
$$
The elements of a set are listed between curly braces. For example, $S=\{ 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 \}$ is the set of decimal digits
Note that the order in which the elements are listed on the page is unimportant, so:
$$
\{ 0,1,2,3 \}\,\text{   and   }\, \{ 3,1,2,0 \}
$$
are the same set
When we work with sets, we ignore any repeated elements, so:
$$
\{ 0,1,1,2,1,3 \}\,\text{   and   }\,\{ 0,1,2,3 \}
$$
are the same set.
We can also descrive a set using the notation:
$$
S=\{ n:n\text{ is an integer},0\leq n\leq 9 \}
$$
which means all $n$ such that the properties to the right of the $:$ hold. Note that $|$ is another notation for $:$
As mentioned above, $x \in S$ means the element $x$ is an element of the set $S$. The negation is $x \not\in S$. For example $3 \in\mathbb{Z}$, but $-4\not\in\mathbb{N}$
