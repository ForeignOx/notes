The real numbers, $\mathbb{R}$ is the [[Sets|set]] of rational and irrational numbers
The real numers are ordered in the sense that if $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, then exactly one of the following holds: $a<b,a=b,a>b$, this is known as trichotomy
## Decimal Representation
Each real number can be represented by a decimal. If $r=\frac{p}{q}$ is a [[Rational Numbers|rational number]], then its decimal representation is found by dividing the denominator $q$ into the numberator $p$. The resulting decimal expansion will either terminate or repeat. For example, $\frac{3}{5}=0.6$ is a terminating decimal and $\frac{15}{11}=1.3636363636\dots=1.\overline{36}$ is a repeating decimal. The converse is true; every terminating or repeating decimal represents a rational number
The decimal representation of an [[Irrational Numbers|irrational number]] neither terminates nor repeats
If ew stop the decimal expansion of a given number at a certain decimal place, then the result is a rational number which appriximates the given number. For instance $3.14$ is a common rational number approximation for $\pi$. More accurate approximations can be obtained by taking more decimal places in the expansions
## Geometric Representation
A fundamental concept in mathematics which connects the abstract notion of a real number with the geometric notion of a point is the representation of the real numbers as points on a straight line. This is done by choosing an arbitary point $O$ on a horizontal line to represent the number $0$, and another point $U$, (usually taken to the right of $O$) to represent the number $\hspace{0pt}1$

The point $O$ is called the origin, and the distance between $O$ and $U$ determines a scale. With $O$ and $U$ specified, each real number can be represented as a point on the line and, conversely, each point on the line represents a real number. A line representing the real numbers is called a real number line; the number associated with a point $P$ on the line is called the coorinate of $P$. The positive numbers are identified with the points on the right side of $O$ and the negative numbers with the points to the left of $O$. The point representing the number $a$ ($a\neq 0$) is $a$ units from $O$ if $a$ is positive, and $-a$ units from $O$ if $a$ is negative
Two important properties of a real number are its sign and size, or magnitude. Geometrically the sign of $a$ tells us whether the point $a$ is on the right or left of $\hspace{0pt}0$ on a number line. The magnitude of $a$ is the distance between the point $a$ and $\hspace{0pt}0$; $\hspace{0pt}0$ itself does not have a sign and its magnitude is $0$. The magnitude of $a$ is more commonly called the [[Absolute Value|absolute value]] of $a$
## Density
Between any two real numbers, there are infinitely many rational numbers and infinitely many irrational numbers. In particular, there is no smallest positive real number
