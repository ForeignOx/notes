$$
\mathbb{Z}=\{ \dots,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\dots \}
$$
A subset of the integers is the positive integers which is equivalent to the [[Natural Numbers]]:
$$
\mathbb{Z}^+=\mathbb{N}=\{ 1,2,3,4,\dots \}
$$
Another subset of the integers is the positive integers including 0:
$$
\mathbb{Z}_{0}^+=\{ 0,1,2,3,\dots \}
