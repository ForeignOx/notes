Let [[Functions|$f(x)$]] be a [[Periodic Functions|periodic]] function with period $2L$, such that on the [[Intervals|interval]] $(-L,L)$ it has a finite number of extrema, a finite number of [[Continuity#Jump Discontinuity|jump discontinuities]], and $\left| f(x) \right|$ is integrable on $(-L,L)$, then its [[Fourier Series|Fourier series]] [[Series|converges]] for all $x$. Furthermore, it converges to $f(x)$ at all points where $f$ is continuous and if $x=a$, is a jump discontinuity, then the Fourier series converges to $\frac{1}{2}(\lim_{ x \to a^{-} }f(x)+\lim_{ x \to a^{+} }f(x))$
