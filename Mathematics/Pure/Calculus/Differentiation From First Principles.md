Suppose we want to find the gradient of the curve $y=f(x)$ at a general point $(x,f(x))$. Choose another point close by, $(x+h,f(x+h))$, where $h$ is small. Hence the gradient of the line between them is:
$$
\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{x+h-x}=\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
$$
By taking $h$ to be as small as possible, i.e. the limit as $h$ tends to 0, we will get the tangent, hence:
$$
f'(x)=\lim_{ h \to 0 } \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
$$
This is known as differentiation from first principles
