For a 2D curve, there is a stationary curve when $\frac{dy}{dx}=0$
For a 3D curve, a stationary point is a point $P$ where the tangent plane is horizontal, so normal is parallel to:
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
0\\0\\1
\end{pmatrix}
$$
And hence for $y=f(x,y)$, 
$$
\frac{ \partial f }{ \partial x } \Bigr{|}_{\substack{P}}=0 \text{ and } \frac{ \partial f }{ \partial y } \Bigr{|}_{P}=0
$$
These are some classifications for stationary points in 3D:
