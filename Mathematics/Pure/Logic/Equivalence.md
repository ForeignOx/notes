Let $A$ and $B$ be [[Proposition|propositions]], we saty "$A$ is equivalent to $B$" for the statement $A\implies B$ and $B\implies A$. We write this as $A\iff B$ 
$$
A\iff B=(A\cap B)\cup(A'\cap B')
$$

| $A$ | $B$ | $A\iff B$ |
| --- | --- | --------- |
| T   | T   | T         |
| T   | F   | F         |
| F   | T   | F         |
| F   | F   | T         |
