Let $s$ be a [[Proposition|proposition]], if $s$ contains no lgical connectives other than [[And| and]] and [[or|or]], then the dual of $s$, denoted $s ^{d}$, is the statement obtained from $s$ by replacing each occurrence of $\cup$ with $\cap$ and $\cap$ with $\cup$, and each occurrence of a tautology $T_{0}$ with a contradiction $F_{0}$, and vice versa
If $p$ is any primitive statement, then $p^{d}$ is the same as $p$, that is, the dual of a primitive statement is simply the same primitive statement
$(\neg p)^{d}$ is also the same as $\neg p$
The propositions $p \cup \neg p$ and $p \cap \neg p$ are duals of each other whenever $p$ is primitive, as are the statements $p \cup T_{0}$ and $p\cap F_{0}$
## Principle of Duality
Let $s$ and $t$ be propositions, if $s\iff t$, then $s^{d}\iff t^{d}$
