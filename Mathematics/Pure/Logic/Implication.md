Let $A$ and $B$ be [[Proposition|propositions]]. We then define the proposition “if $A$ then $B$" which is defined to be false when $A$ is true and $B$ is false, and true in all other cases. We write this as $A\implies B$, $A$ implies $B$
$$
A\implies B=(A\cap B)\cup A'
$$

| $A$ | $B$ | $A\implies B$ |
| --- | --- | ------------- |
| T   | T   | T             |
| T   | F   | F             |
| F   | T   | T             |
| F   | F   | T             |

This gives rise to some strange propositions such as:
    “If $p$ is the largest prime, then $p$ is $\hspace{0pt}72$"
Which is a true proposition
