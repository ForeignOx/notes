A sequence is an ordered set of numbers
$$
a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\dots
$$
A sequence is an infinite list of real numbers
A sequence is a function whose domain is $\mathbb{N}$ and whose codomain is $\mathbb{R}$. Given a function $f:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{R}$, $f(n)$ is the nth term in the sequence
$a_{n}$ can be used to describe the whole sequence even though a more rigorous way of writing it would be $\{ a_{n} \}$
Let $a_{n}$ be a sequence of real numbers. $a_{n}$ is said to be:
- strictly increasing if, $\forall n\in\mathbb{N},a_{n}<a_{n+1}$,
- increasing if, $\forall n\in\mathbb{N},a_{n}\leq a_{n+1}$,
- strictly decreasing if, $\forall n\in\mathbb{N},a_{n}>a_{n+1}$,
- decreasing if, $\forall n\in\mathbb{N},a_{n}\geq a_{n+1}$,
- monotonic if it is increasing or decreasing or both
- non-monotonic if it is neither increasing nor decreasing
