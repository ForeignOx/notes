 For a recurrence relation like so:
$$
a_{1}u_{n-k}+a_{2}u_{n-k+1}+\dots+a_{k-1}u_{n-1}+a_{k}u_{n}=f(n)
$$
You must solve it in two parts, the homogeneous solution and the particular solution
## Homogeneous Solution
Take the homogeneous part of $u_{n}$:
$$
a_{1}u_{n-k}+a_{2}u_{n-k+1}+\dots+a_{k-1}u_{n-1}+a_{k}u_{n}=0
$$
We can convert this to an auxiliary equation:
$$
a_{1}+a_{2}m+\dots+a_{k-1}m^{k-1}+a_{k}m^{k}=0
$$
With roots $m_{1}, m_{2}, \dots, m_{k}$, then we can write the ordinal equation as:
$$
h_{n}=A_{1}m_{1}^{n}+A_{2}m_{2}^{n}+\dots+A_{k}m_{k}^{n}
$$
If there are two repeated roots, then instead of writing for example $A_{i}m_{i}^{n}+A_{j}m_{i}^{n}$, you'd write $(A_{i}+A_{j}n)m_{i}^{n}$. If there are more than two, then you'd combine them into a polynomial in terms of $n$ multiplied by $m_{i}^{n}$, where the polynomial would be of an order of one less than the number of repeated roots
If a pair of roots are complex conjugates, then instead of writing for example $A_{i}m_{i}^{n}+A_{j}(m_{i}^{*})^{n}$, we can write them in modulus argument form:
$$
A_{i}(r e^{ i\theta })^{n}+A_{j}(r e^{ -i\theta })^{n}=r^{n}(A_{i}(\cos\theta+i\sin\theta)^{n}+A_{j}(\cos\theta-i\sin\theta)^{n})
$$
$$
=r^{n}(A_{i}(\cos n\theta+i\sin n\theta)+A_{j}(\cos n\theta-i\sin n\theta))
$$
$$
=r^{n}(B_{i}\cos n\theta+B_{j}\sin n\theta)
$$
## Particular Solution
Next you consider the $f(n)$, you essentially need to find a general version of $f(n)$ and then substitute this back into the full recurrence relation by $u_{n}=f(n)$, and hence $u_{n-k}=f(n-k)$ and so on. By comparing coefficients or otherwise, the particular solution is found
Finally, sum the homogeneous and particular solutions and use the initial conditions to form a system of equations which are then used to find the solution to the recurrence relation
### $f(n)=0$
In this case no more work is needed
### $f(n)$ is a polynomial
Try a general polynomial of the same degree
### $f(n)$ is an exponential
If $f(n)=a^{n}$, try $\beta a^{n}$, unless $a$ is a root of the homogeneous part, in which case you treat it as a repeated root
### $f(n)$ is a polynomial multiplied by an exponential
Simply use a general polynomial multiplied by an exponential with the same base
