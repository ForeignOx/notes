## Addition
$$
a+b
$$
Addition is commutative: $a+b=b+a$
$\mathbb{N}$ are closed under addition 
$\mathbb{Z}$ are closed under addition
$\mathbb{Q}$ are closed under addition
$\mathbb{R}$ are closed under addition
$\mathbb{C}$ are closed under addition
Addition is a geometric translation
## Subtraction
Subtraction is the inverse of addition
$$
a+b=c \implies a=c-b
$$
Subtraction is not commutative: $a-b \neq b-a$
$\mathbb{N}$ are not closed under subtraction $(1-2)$, so a larger set is needed; 
$\mathbb{Z}$ are closed under subtraction
$\mathbb{Q}$ are closed under subtraction
$\mathbb{R}$ are closed under subtraction
$\mathbb{C}$ are closed under subtraction
Subtraction is a geometric translation
## Multiplication
Multiplication is repeated addition
$$
\underbrace{a+a+\dots+a}_{b \text{ times}}=a\times b
$$
Multiplication is commutative: $a\times b=b\times a$
$\mathbb{N}$ are closed under multiplication
$\mathbb{Z}$ are closed under multiplication
$\mathbb{Q}$ are closed under multiplication
$\mathbb{R}$ are closed under multiplication
$\mathbb{C}$ are closed under multiplication
Multiplication is a geometric stretch and rotation
## Division
Division is the inverse of multiplication
$$
a\times b=c \implies a=c \div b
$$
It can also be thought of as repeated subtraction
$$
b-a-a-\dots-a
$$
is how many times you can fit $a$ into $b$
Division is not commutative: $a\div b\neq b\div a$
$\mathbb{N}$ are not closed under division ($1\div 2$)
$\mathbb{Z}$ are not closed under division ($1\div 2$), so a larger set is needed; 
$\mathbb{Q}$ are closed under division (except dividing by 0)
$\mathbb{R}$ are closed under division (except dividing by 0)
$\mathbb{C}$ are closed under division (except dividing by 0)
Division is a geometric stretch and rotation 
## Exponentiation
Exponentiation is repeated multiplication
$$
\underbrace{a\times a\times\dots \times a}_{b \text{ times}}=a^{b}
$$
Exponentiation is not commutative: $a^{b}\neq b^{a}$
$\mathbb{N}$ are closed under exponentiation
$\mathbb{Z}$ are not closed under exponentiation ($2^{-1}$)
$\mathbb{Q}$ are not closed under exponentiation ($2^{1/2}$)
$\mathbb{R}$ are not closed under exponentiation $(-1)^{1/2}$
$\mathbb{C}$ are closed under exponentiation (except $0^{0}$)
## Roots
(Positive) roots are one of two inverses of exponentiation
$$
a^{b}=c \implies a = \sqrt[b]{ c }
$$
Roots are not commutative: $\sqrt[a]{b  }\neq \sqrt[b]{a  }$
$\mathbb{N}$ are not closed under roots ($\sqrt{ 2 }$)
$\mathbb{Z}$ are not closed under roots ($\sqrt{ 2 }$)
$\mathbb{Q}$ are not closed under roots ($\sqrt{ 2 }$)
$\mathbb{R}$ are not closed under roots ($\sqrt{ -1 }$)
$\mathbb{C}$ are closed under roots (except the zeroth root)
## Logarithms
Logarithms are the other inverse of exponentiation
$$
a^{b}=c \implies b=\log_{a}(c)
$$
$\mathbb{N}$ are not closed under logarithms ($\log(2)$)
$\mathbb{Z}$ are not closed under logarithms ($\log(2)$)
$\mathbb{Q}$ are not closed under logarithms ($\log(2)$)
$\mathbb{R}$ are not closed under logarithms ($\log(-2)$)
$\mathbb{C}$ are closed under logarithms (except $\log(0)$)
