Conic sections are equations of the form:
$$
Ax^{2}+By^{2}+Cx+Dy+E=0
$$
Where $A,B,C,D,E$ are constants and $A$ and $B$ are not both $0$. The [[Graph of a Function|graph]] of such an equation is, in general, a conic section; that is, a circle, elliple, parabola or hyperbola
We say “in general” as there are some degenerate cases, such as $x^{2}+y^{2}=0$ consists of a single point $(0,0)$. The equation $x^{2}+y^{2}+1=0$ has no graph, as there are no ordered pairs $(x,y)$ of [[Real Numbers|real numbers]] that satisfy this equation
There are more formal ways to describe the comic forms, but these equations are a nice generalisation
## Circle
This is the case when $A=B$, so can take the form:
$$
x^{2}+y^{2}+C_{1}x+D_{1}y+E_{1}=0
$$
(after dividing by $A$)
Standard forms include:
$$
x^{2}+y^{2}=r^{2}
$$
Which is a circle of radius $r$ centred at the origin
$$
(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}
$$
Which is a circle of radius $r$ centred at $P(h,k)$, which can be thought of as a [[Transformations of Functions|translation]] of the circle centred at the origin

## Ellipse
This is the case where $A,B$ have the same sign, but $A\neq B$
A standard form is:
$$
\frac{(x-h)^{2}}{a^{2}}+\frac{(y-k)^{2}}{b^{2}}
$$
Which is an ellipse centred at the point $P(h,k)$ with major axis whichever is the greater of $a$ and $b$, the other being the minor axis. A way of thinking about this is that you are stretching a circle in the $x$ axis by a factor of $a^{2}$ and in the $y$ axis by a factor of $b^{2}$

## Parabola
Either $A=0$ or $B=0$, these are also [[quadratic equations]]
Standard forms include:
$$
(x-h)^{2}=4c(y-k)
$$
Which is a parabola, vertex at the point $P(h,k)$ and axis vertical, similarly another is:
$$
(y-k)^{2}=4c(x-h)
$$Which is a parabola with vertex at the point $P(h,k)$, but with the axis horizontal
![[Conic Sections 2024-10-27 17.29.51.excalidraw]]
## Hyperbola
This is the case where $A$ and $B$ have opposite sign
Standard forms include:
$$
\frac{(x-h)^{2}}{a^{2}}-\frac{(y-k)^{2}}{b^{2}}=1
$$
Which is a hyperbola, centre at the point $P(h,k)$ and axis horizontal, similarly another is:
$$
\frac{(y-k)^{2}}{b^{2}}-\frac{(x-h)^{2}}{a^{2}}=1
$$
Which is a hyperbola with centre at the point $P(h,k)$ and axis vertical

Standard forms are obtained from the general form $Ax^{2}+By^{2}+Cx+Dy+E=0$ and completing the square
The circle, the ellipse, the parabola, and the hyperbola are known as the conic sections because each of these configurations can be obtained by slicing a double right circular cone by a suitably inclined plane:
