If a procedure can be broken down into first and second stages, and if there are $m$ possible outcomes for the first stage and if, for each of these outcomes, there are $n$ possible outcomes for the second stage, then the total procedure can be carried out, in the designated order, in $mn$ ways
This is also referred to as the principle of choice or the multiplication principle
Note that the rule can be extended to more than two stages
If for $1\leq i\leq k$ there are $n_{i}$ choices for the $i$th item in a [[arrangements|list]] regardless of previous choices, then the number of possible lists is $n_{1\times}n_{2}\times\dots \times n_{k}$
## Example
A label identifier for a computer system consists of one letter (A-Z) followed by $\hspace{0pt}3$ digits (0-9). How many distinct identifiers are possible
a) if repetitions are allowed
b) if repetitions are not allowed
### Solution
a)
![[Multiplication Principle 2024-10-15 15.36.49.excalidraw]]
so the answer would be $26\times 10\times 10\times 10=26000$
b)
![[Multiplication Principle 2024-10-15 15.37.51.excalidraw]]
so the answer would be $26\times 10\times 9\times 8$
