A permutation on a [[sets|set]] $S$ is a [[Arrangements|list]] of elements of $S$ using each element exactly once
## Example
The permutations on set $\{ M,A,T,H \}$ are:
MATH,MAHT,MHTA,... ($\hspace{0pt}24$ total)
## Proposition
If $|S|=n$ there are $n!$ permutations on $S$
### Proof
This is the same as [[Arrangements#Standard Problem $ hspace{0pt}2$ (yippeee)|this standard problem]] with $n=k$, so in our example there are $4\neq 24$ permutations
