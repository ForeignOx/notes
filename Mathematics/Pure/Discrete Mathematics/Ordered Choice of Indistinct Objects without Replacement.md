In general, if there are $n$ objects with $n_{1}$ of a first type, $n_{2}$ of a second type,..., and $n_{r}$ of an $r$th type, where $n_{1}+n_{2}+\dots+n_{r}=n$, then there are:
$$
\frac{n!}{n_{1}!\times n_{2}!\times \dots \times n_{r}!}
$$
linear [[Arrangements|arrangements]] of the given $n$ objects (objects of the same type are indistinguishable)
## Examples
The number of linear arrangements of the four letters in the word ball is $\hspace{0pt}12$, not $4!=24$ which we'd expect from the [[Permutations|permutations]], this is because we don't have
