If a first task can be performed in $m$ ways, whie a second task, while a second task can be performed in $n$ ways, and the two tasks cannot be performed simultaneously, then performing either task can be accomplished in any one of $m+n$ ways
Note that when we say that a particular occurence, such as a first task, can come about in $m$ ways, these $m$ ways are assumed to be distinct, unless a statement is made to the contrary
Note that the rule can be extended beyond two tasks als long as no pair of the tasks can occur simultaneously
## Examples
### Example 1
A college library has $\hspace{0pt}40$ textbooks on sociology and $\hspace{0pt}50$ textbooks dealing with anthropology. By the rule of sum, a student can select amont $40+50=90$ textbooks in order to learn more about one or the other of these two subjects
