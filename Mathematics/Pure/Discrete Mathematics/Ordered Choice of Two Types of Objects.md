If we have $m$ objects, we want to choose $r$ objects of type $\hspace{0pt}1$ $m-r$ objects of type 2, the number of distinct ordered choices is:
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
m\\r
\end{pmatrix}
$$
You can think about it as if you have $m$ places, $r$ of these will be placed with objects of type $\hspace{0pt}1$, then the remaining $m-r$ places must then be filled with the objects of type 2
## Example
Toss a "fair" coin $\hspace{0pt}7$ times
$$
E:=\{ \text{There are a total of }3\text{ heads, H} \}
$$
Find $\mathbb{P}(E)$
The unrestricted number of all possible choices is $|\Omega|=2^7$
