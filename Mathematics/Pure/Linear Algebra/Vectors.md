Vectors are points in $n$-space, where the coordinates of the point are given by the elements of the vector
Vectors can be the point, or they can be thought of as the directions to a point, or they can be thought of as simply the direction in general
Vectors can have be $n$ dimensional and are represented as an ordered system of $n$ numbers $a_{i}(i=1,2,\dots,n)$ such as:
$$
\vec{a}=\begin{pmatrix}
a_{1}\\a_{2}\\\vdots\\a_{i}\\\vdots\\a_{n}
\end{pmatrix}
$$
The number $a_{i}$ is called the $i$th component
Two vectors:
$$
\vec{a}=\begin{pmatrix}
a_{1}\\a_{2}\\\vdots\\a_{n}
\end{pmatrix},\vec{b}=\begin{pmatrix}
b_{1}\\b_{2}\\\vdots\\b_{n'}
\end{pmatrix}
$$
Are equal if and only if the dimensions $n$ and $n'$ are equal and, furthermore, the corresponding components $a_{i}$ and $b_{i}$ are equal for all $1\leq i\leq n$, thus we can say $\vec{a}=\vec{b}$
When two vectors $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ are given, the equation
$$
\vec{x}+\vec{a}=\vec{b}
$$
is satisfied by exactly one vector $\vec{x}$ given by $\vec{b}+(-\vec{a})=\vec{b}-\vec{a}$, hence $x_{i}=b_{i}-a_{i}$
For a given scalar $\lambda \neq 0$ and a vector $\vec{a}$, the equation
$$
\lambda \vec{x}=\vec{a}
$$
is satisfied by the unique vector given by $\left( \frac{1}{\lambda} \right)\vec{a}$, so $x_{i}=\frac{a_{i}}{\lambda}$
