Pick a point $\vec{a}\in\Pi$ on the plane and two [[Vectors|vectors]] $\vec{d_{1}},\vec{d_{2}}\in\mathbb{R}^3$ parallel to $\Pi$ but not parallel to each other and such that $\vec{d_{1}}\neq \vec{0}$,$\vec{d_{2}}\neq \vec{0}$
To get to a general point on the plane $\vec{p}\in\Pi$, you first travel from the origin to the point $\vec{a}$ on the plane and then some multiples of $\vec{d_{1}}$ and some multiples of $\vec{d_{2}}$, so:
$$
\Pi=\{ \vec{a}+\lambda_{1}d_{1}+\lambda_{2}d_{2}|\lambda_{1},\lambda_{2}\in \mathbb{R} \}
$$
Here $\lambda_{1},\lambda_{2}$ are called "free variables" and the fact that there are two of them links to the fact that planes are two-dimensional
