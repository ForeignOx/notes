The roots of a quadratic equation
$$
ax^{2}+bx+c=0
$$
with $a\neq 0$ are given by the quadratic formula:
$$
r=\frac{-b\pm \sqrt{ b^{2}-4ac }}{2a}
$$
## Discriminant
$$
b^{2}-4ac
$$
is known as the discriminant of the quadratic equation
If $b^{2}-4ac>0$, the equation has two [[Real Numbers|real]] roots, $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$ from the $\pm$ symbol, and the expression can be rewritten in the factored form:
$$
ax^{2}+bx+c=a(x-r_{1})(x-r_{2})
$$
If $b^{2}-4ac=0$, the equation has one real root and $r_{1}=r_{2}=-\frac{b}{2a}$. Here, the expression can be rewritten in the factored form:
$$
ax^{2}+bx+c=a(x-r)^{2}
$$
If $b^{2}-4ac<0$, the equation has no real roots, but it will have $\hspace{0pt}2$ complex roots that will be the complex conjugates of one another
