Some [[Functions|functions]] may be defined piecewise, i.e. with different expressions at diffferent [[Intervals|intervals]] of the domain, this can lead to discontinuities in the function
A common example is a step function which is constant on each piece such as the Heaviside Step functions:
$$
H(x)=\begin{cases}
0&&x<0\\1&&x>0
\end{cases}
$$
