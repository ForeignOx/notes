A function $f:D\to C$ is a map ($f$) from a [[sets|set]] $D$ called the domain ($\text{Dom}f$), to a set $C$ called the codomain $\text{Codom}$f
For every $x\in D$, there is a unique $f(x)\in C$ called the image of $x$ under $f$

We sometimes write:
$$
f:D\to C
$$
$$
x\mapsto f(x)
$$
## Functions of a Single Real Variable
These are functions where the domain is $\mathbb{R}$, or a subset
## Real-Valued Functions
Real valued functions are functions where the codomain is $\mathbb{R}$ or a subset

## Examples
Consider a function $f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ given by $f(x)=x^{2},\,\forall x\in\mathbb{R}$, so $\text{Dom}f=\mathbb{R}$, $\text{Codom}f=\mathbb{R}$, but $\text{Ran}f=[0,\infty)$ 
Here the codomain was a choice that could have been more restrictive, but having the codomain be $\mathbb{R}$, we can compose this function with other functions with domain $\mathbb{R}$
