A [[Functions|function]]
$$
f:D\to C
$$
is injective ifL
$$
\forall x_{1},x_{2}\in \mathbb{R},f(x_{1})\neq f(x_{2})
$$
With $x_{1}\neq x_{2}$
It is an evil convention to call injective functions "one to one"
## Horizontal Line Test
If no horizontal line intersects the [[Graph of a Function|graph]] of $f$ more than once, then $f$ is injective, otherwise, it is not

## Example
$f(x)=2x+1$ is injective since $f(x_{1})=f(x_{2})\implies x_{1}=x_{2}$
$f(x)=x^{2}$ is not injective since $f(x)=f(-x)$, but $x\neq-x\forall x\neq 0$
