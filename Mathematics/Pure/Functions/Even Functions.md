We say that a [[Real Functions|function]] $f$ is even if we always have $f(x)=f(-x)\forall x\in \text{Dom}f$. This means that its graph has reflectional symmetry around $x=0$
Note that the function $f(x)=x^n+c$ is even for even $n$, in fact the sum of even functions will be an even function
All functions can be written as the sum of an even part and an [[Odd Functions|odd part]] where $f_\text{even}(x)=\frac{1}{2}(f(x)+f(-x))$ and $f_\text{odd}=\frac{1}{2}(f(x)-f(-x))$ Decomposing functions into odd and even parts can simplify calculations
Note that this is the definition of the hyperbolic trigonometric functions by decomposing the function $f(x)=e^x$
$$
f_\text{even}(x)=\frac{1}{2}(e^x+e^{-x}):=\cosh x
$$
$$
f_\text{odd}(x)=\frac{1}{2}(e^x-e^{-x}):=\sinh x
$$
$$
e^x=\cosh x+\sinh x
$$
The product of two odd functions is an even function, the product of two even functions is an even function and the product of an even function and an odd function is an odd function
