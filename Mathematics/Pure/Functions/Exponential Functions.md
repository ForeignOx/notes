An exponentiasl [[Real Functions|function]] is any function of the form $f(x)=b^{x}$, where $b$ (called the base) is a positive real number not equal to $\hspace{0pt}1$
For all values of the base, the graph passes through the point $(0,1)$
There are two types of behaviour
- If $b>1$, the graph is increasing and has a horizontal asymtote $y=0$ along the negative $x$-axis
- If $0<b<1$ the graph is decreasing and has a horizontal asymtote $y=0$ along the positive $x$-axis
Two important properties of exponential functions are
$$
b^{x}b^{y}=b^{x+y}\text{      and      } (b^{x})^{y}=b^{xy}
$$
There is a special value of the base (called the natural base) $b=e$. One of the many reasons why $e$ is special is that the gradient of the graph of $e^{x}$ is always equal to $e^{x}$. Another way to say this is
$$
\frac{d}{dx}e^{x}=e^{x}
$$
