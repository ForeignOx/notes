The graph of $f$ (where $f$ is a real valued [[Functions|function]] of a single real variable) is the set of all points $(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2$ such that $x\in \text{Dom}f$, $y=f(x)$
To sketch $f$, we often just restrict the domain to an [[Intervals|interval]], we often pick a region such that the graph shows significant features like turning points and intercepts
When necessary, we use a closed shaded circle to indicate an included point, and an open unshaded circle to indicate an excluded point
The graph of a function is a curve, but not every curve is the graph of a function
## The vertical line test
If any vertical line intersects the curve more than once, then the curve is not the graph of a function
