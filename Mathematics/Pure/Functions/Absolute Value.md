Two important properties of a [[Real Numbers|real number]] are its sign and size, or magnitude. Geometrically the sign of $a$ tells us whether the point $a$ is on the right or left of $\hspace{0pt}0$ on a number line. The magnitude of $a$ is the distance between the point $a$ and $\hspace{0pt}0$; $\hspace{0pt}0$ itself does not have a sign and its magnitude is $0$. The magnitude of $a$ is more commonly called the absolute value of $a$, denoted $|a|$
For $x \in \mathbb{R}$
$$
|x|=\begin{cases}
x && \text{for }x\geq 0\\-x && \text{for }x<0
\end{cases}=\text{max}(a,-a)=\sqrt{ a^{2} }
$$
Geometrically, $|a|$ represents the distance between $a$ and $0$, $|a-c|$ represents the distance between $a$ and $c$
## Properties
- $|a|=0\iff a=0$
- $|-a|=|a|$
- $|ab|=|a||b|$
- $|a+b|\leq|a|+|b|$, known as the triangle inequlity. This is analogous to the fact that in a triangle the length of one side cannot exceed the sum of the lengths of the other two sides
- $||a|-|b| |\leq|a-b|$ this is a variant of the triangle inequality
- $|a|^{2}=|a^{2}|=a^{2}$
