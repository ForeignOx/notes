A logarithm is the [[Inverses of Functions|inverse]] of an [[Exponential Functions|exponential]] [[Real Functions|function]]: if $y=b^{x}$, then $x=\log_{b}(y)$. As with exponential functions, we have to specify the base of the logarithm
The domain of a logarithm function is the image of an exponential function and hence is $(0,\infty)$. The image of a logarithm function is the domain of an exponential function and thus is $\mathbb{R}$
When the base of a logarithm is $e$, we call our function the natural logarithm denoted by $\ln (x)$ 
A logarithm grows very slowly as $x$ grows large and positive (more slowly than a linear function) and has a vertical asymptote at $x=0$
Some important properties of logarithms are:
- $\log_{b}1=0$ (this follows from $b^{0}=1$)
- $\log_{b}b^{x}=x$
- $\log_{b}\alpha\beta=\log_{b}\alpha+\log_{b}\beta$
- $\log_{b} \frac{\alpha}{\beta}=\log_{b}\alpha-\log_{b}\beta$
- $\log_{b}(x^{r})=r\log_{b}x$
