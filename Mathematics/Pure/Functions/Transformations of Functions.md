The graph of a [[Real Functions|function]] $f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ can be shifted, reflected and rescaled by applying some simple transformations to the function and its argument, as follows:
## Translation
$f(x)+a$ shifts the graph of $f(x)$ up by an amount $a$
$f(x+b)$ shifts the graph of $f(x)$ to the left by an amount $b$
## Reflection
$-f(x)$ reflects the graph of $f(x)$ about the $x$-axis
$f(-x)$ reflects the graph of $f(x)$ about the $y$-axis
$|f(x)|$ reflects the portions of the graph of $f(x)$ that are below the $x$-axis about the $x$-axis
## Scalling
$\lambda f(x)$ is a vertical stretch of the graph $f(x)$ if $\lambda>1$ and a vertical contraction if $0<\lambda<1$
$f(\mu x)$ is a horizontal contraction of the graph of $f(x)$ if $\mu>1$ and a horizontal stretch if $0<\mu<1$
