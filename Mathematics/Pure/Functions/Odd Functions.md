We say that a [[Real Functions|function]] $f$ is odd if we always have $f(x)=-f(-x)\forall x\in \text{Dom}f$. This means that its graph has rotational symmetry around the origin (and must have $f(0)=0$ if $\hspace{0pt}0$ is in the domain)
Note that the function $f(x)=x^n$ is odd for odd $n$, but $f(x)=x^n+c$ is not unless $c=0$
All functions can be written as the sum of an odd part and an [[Even Functions|even part]] where $f_\text{even}(x)=\frac{1}{2}(f(x)+f(-x))$ and $f_\text{odd}=\frac{1}{2}(f(x)-f(-x))$. Decomposing functions into odd and even parts can simplify calculations
Note that this is the definition of the hyperbolic trigonometric functions by decomposing the function $f(x)=e^x$
$$
f_\text{even}(x)=\frac{1}{2}(e^x+e^{-x}):=\cosh x
$$
$$
f_\text{odd}(x)=\frac{1}{2}(e^x-e^{-x}):=\sinh x
$$
$$
e^x=\cosh x+\sinh x
$$
The product of two odd functions is an even function, the product of two even functions is an even function and the product of an even function and an odd function is an odd function
